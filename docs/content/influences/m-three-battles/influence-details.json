This was a key event that led to the eventual destruction of the Nephites as a people by their Lamanite enemies. When he describes this event, Mormon uses words that allude to another set of three battles from earlier Israelite history, which caused the near annihilation of the tribe of Benjamin (Judges 21-22).",
