The final chapters of the book of Judges, like those in Mormon 1-6, were a dark time in the history of Israel. Instead of doing what was right before God, every man did what was right in his own eyes. As one biblical scholar states, "It shows how Israel’s hospitality, warfare, justice, and politics were all debased because of the moral blindness and/or perversity of its citizens (including Levites and elders) and the consequent malfunctioning of its institutions. Yahweh’s displeasure, and his sovereignty, find expression in the chastisement he brings to bear on the whole community." <sup>1</sup> <br><br>
When the Benjaminite town of Gibeah refuses to hand over men accused of a crime, the other tribes of Israel go to war against them, resulting in three destructive battles. During the first two battles, the Benjaminites manage to defeat the forces of Israel. During the third battle, however, the men of Israel are able to draw the forces of Benjamin out of the city and destroy them in an ambush. In this and subsequent engagements, all but a few hundred of the men of Benjamin are destroyed.<br><br>
Mormon’s description of the three battles at the city of Desolation recall the biblical story, but he notably casts the Nephites in the role of doomed Benjamin, and the Lamanites as the other tribes of Israel. During the first two battles, the Nephites defeat the Lamanites, but during the third, the Nephites are drawn out of their stronghold and suffer a disastrous defeat. The comparison between the tribe of Benjamin and the people of Nephi is particularly apt, since both Israelite groups were nearly destroyed. The connection between the two stories is strengthened by Mormon’s use of words that evoke the three battles in Judges.<br><br>
During the third battle, the army of Benjamin "went <b><i>out"</i></b> of their fortress to fight (Judges 20:31). Similarly, the Nephites in their third battle went "<b><i>out"</i></b> from their fortified land of Desolation to fight the Lamanites (Mormon 4:1).<br><br>
During the third battle between the Israelites and Benjamin’s army, "the <b><i>battle</i></b> was <b><i>sore"</i></b> (Judges 20:34). Similarly, during the third engagement between the Nephites and the Lamanites, Mormon says, "they had a <b><i>sore battle"</i></b> (Mormon 4:2).<br><br>
