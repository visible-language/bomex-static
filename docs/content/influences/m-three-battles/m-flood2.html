<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By alluding to the language of the account preceding the destruction by Flood, Mormon skillfully highlights the gross wickedness of his people for the reader, without having to go into awful detail. While both the Lamanites and the Nephites were wicked, the wickedness of the Nephites far exceeded that of the Lamanites (Moroni 9:20) and was similar, as witnessed by Mormon, to the wickedness of man in the days of Noah. <br><br>
Mormon’s words are a warning to us today of the dangers of pervasive and continual wickedness. In our day, we are surrounded by such wickedness. As we repent daily and follow the teachings in the Book of Mormon, we can help our society avoid the destruction of individuals, groups, and entire societies that occurred in the Book of Mormon (Mormon 5:22).<br><br>
