The revelation of the Lord touching with His finger the stones presented by the Brother of Jared (Ether 3:6) is presented by Moroni as a reversal of the Fall by partaking of the forbidden fruit. Adam was commanded not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:17): "neither shall ye <b><i>touch</i></b> it, lest ye die" (Genesis 3:3). Contrary to this commandment, the man "<b><i>put forth</i></b> his hand" (Genesis 3:22) and partook, resulting in death and mankind being cut off from God’s presence. <br><br>
In Ether, however, the Brother of Jared did not put forth his hand, but humbly asked the Lord to do so by touching the stones he had prepared to give them light. Moroni then says that "the Lord <b><i>stretched forth</i></b> his hand and <b><i>touched</i></b> the stones one by one with his finger" to provide light for the man and his people (Ether 3:6). In contrast to Genesis, the man did not attempt to usurp knowledge for himself in violation of a commandment, but asked <b><i>the Lord</i></b> to touch what he had prepared and offered in faith and humility. Adam’s eyes were opened after he partook of the forbidden fruit, just as the veil was taken from off the eyes of the Brother of Jared, allowing him to see the finger of the Lord. <br><br>
When man fell, he was afraid and <b><i>hid</i></b> himself because of his nakedness before God. When the Brother of Jared saw the finger of the Lord unveiled before his eyes, he too was afraid and "fell" to the ground. Having exercised patience and faith, with his eyes now opened, and at the Lord’s initiative, the man was shown all things and commanded to write them down and then <b><i>hide</i></b> them up. <br><br>
The forbidden fruit of the tree could make one <b><i>wise</i></b> (Genesis 3:6). The Lord commanded that the things Jared’s brother had seen and written should be <b><i>hidden up</i></b> and sealed. Joseph Smith was commanded to "<b><i>touch them not;</i></b> ... for that thing," like the fruit of the tree of knowledge, "is forbidden you, except… it shall be <b><i>wisdom</i></b> in God" (Ether 5:1). As partaking of the fruit brought death and caused man to be cast out of God’s presence, the Lord’s response to another man’s faith gave him knowledge and brought him back into His presence for eventual eternal life (Ether 3:14).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Moroni’s use of language from the Fall of Adam and Eve helps to underscore how we, as fallen creatures in a mortal world, can be redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ, and how we can approach God and be recognized and blessed. Just as the Brother of Jared was joyfully surprised by what he learned, we too can be blessed and rejoice as we follow the pattern provided in Moroni’s account. <br><br>
As we read the Brother of Jared’s story, we should ponder how a knowledge of Jesus Christ and His gospel can open our eyes to the joys made possible through our Heavenly Father’s plan. Humility, patience, and faithful diligence before the Lord will open the windows of heaven to greater happiness.
