      In the Genesis story, before the Flood, the <b><i>sons</i></b> of God "saw the daughters of men that they were <b><i>fair;</i></b></i></b> and they took them <b><i>wives</i></b> of all whom they chose" (Genesis: 6:2). In the book of Ether, it is not a man, but the cunning daughter of wicked Jared, who introduces the idea of a murderous conspiracy to obtain power. The daughter of Jared said to her father, "And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the <b><i>son </i></b>of Kimnor; and behold, I am <b><i>fair,</i></b> and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to <b><i>wife"</i></b> (Ether 8:10). <br><br>
Once the kingdom is overthrown, Akish uses the same tool of secret combinations to murder his father-in-law, Jared. "For so <b><i>great</i></b> had been the spreading of this <b><i>wicked</i></b> and secret society, that it had <b><i>corrupted </i></b>the hearts of all the people" (Ether 9:6). After the Flood, the Lord gave Noah commandments against the shedding of blood. "And whoso <b><i>sheddeth man’s blood,</i></b> by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man" (Genesis 9:6). After he describes the conspiracy of Jared and Akish, Moroni reminds the reader that "the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that <b><i>man should shed blood,</i></b> but in all things hath forbidden it from the beginning of man" (Ether 8:19).  <br><br>
In the Genesis story, "God saw that the <b><i>wickedness</i></b> of man was <b><i>great"</i></b> (Genesis 6:5), "the earth was <b><i>corrupt</i></b> before God," and "the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was <b><i>corrupt;</i></b> for all flesh had <b><i>corrupted</i></b> his way upon the earth" (Genesis 6:11-12). In the Genesis story, the daughters of men give birth to mighty men who lead society into a cycle of wickedness and violence (Genesis 6:4-5, 13). In Ether, the sons of Akish engage in a bloody civil war with their father (Ether 9:12). <br><br>
Notably, King Omer and his righteous family and followers, like Noah and his family, were preserved and protected by God during all of this wickedness and destruction. The Genesis account says the wicked at the time of the Flood "were <b><i>destroyed</i></b> from the earth; and <b><i>Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him</i></b> in the ark" (Genesis 6:23). The civil war between Akish and his sons resulted in "the <b><i>destruction</i></b> of nearly all the people of the kingdom, yea, even <b><i>all, save it were for thirty souls, and they who fled with the house of Omer"</i></b> (Ether 9:12-13). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By using language from the Flood narrative, Moroni highlights the destructive nature of secret and murderous combinations. Just as the gross wickedness and violence of the people led to destruction at the time of the Flood, the introduction of secret combinations by Jared, his daughter, and Akish led to the almost total destruction of the kingdom in Omer’s day. As we read the book of Ether, we should note that we too live in a time when there is a flood of violence and wickedness. The Book of Mormon can teach us how the words of Christ can preserve us and carry us through.

<sup>1</sup>  When Cain killed his brother Abel, the Lord told him that "the voice of thy brother’s <b><i>blood crieth</i></b> unto me <b><i>from the ground"</i></b> (Genesis 4:10). Speaking of secret combinations, Moroni states "that the <b><i>blood</i></b> of [the Lord’s] saints, which shall be shed by them," shall "<b><i>cry</i></b> unto him <b><i>from the ground"</i></b> (Ether 8:22).
