      <h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>By evoking the language found in Genesis and the Book of Moses, Moroni frames the introduction of evil knowledge and the practice of secret combinations as a second Fall in which the Jaredites bring death and destruction upon themselves by partaking of evil fruit. His account is a timely warning about the consequences of seeking evil, rather than seeking the knowledge of righteousness freely offered by God. By divine direction through His prophets, the Lord provides us with knowledge of how we can avoid the evil works of the devil and the conspiring designs of the wicked.
