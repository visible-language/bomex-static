In the Moses account of the Fall of Man, the Lord commanded Adam and Eve, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I <b><i>forbid it"</i></b> (Moses 3:17). The last phrase does not appear in the Genesis version; however, Moroni does reference it in his warning about the dangers of secret combinations. Moroni says, "For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath <b><i>forbidden it</i></b> from the beginning of man" (Ether 8:19). Secrets combinations and all the evils associated with them are forbidden, just as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was forbidden to man in the beginning. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>God forbade man to partake of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but Adam and Eve partook, an act that introduced them to death. In mortality, we encounter both good and evil in our lives. The story of the Jaredites teaches the dangers of secret combinations, which are promoted by the adversary to those who hearken to him. It often takes faith or trust in God to choose to act in righteousness, rather than follow the devil. As we read the Book of Ether, we should ponder how we can develop greater trust in our Redeemer and strength to stand for and share what is good.
