In Genesis, after Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, the Lord said, "And I will put <b><i>enmity</i></b> between <b><i>thee</i></b> and the woman, and between <b><i>thy seed</i></b> and <b><i>her seed;</i></b> it shall <b><i>bruise thy head,</i></b> and thou shalt bruise his heel" (Genesis 3:15). Moroni’s account of Jared, his daughter, Akish, and his children draws upon the background of the Lord’s prophecy to Adam and Eve in the biblical story. <br><br>
In Ether, after Jared and his daughter introduced secret combinations, enmity abounded. Shortly after Jared obtained the kingdom, Akish "applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they obtained the <b>head</b> of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people" (Ether 9:5). After killing his father-in-law, "Akish began to be jealous of his son" and killed him (Ether 9:7). There followed a civil war between Akish and his other sons (Ether 9:10) until everyone in the kingdom was dead, except for a few (Ether 9:12). Moroni’s account shows that the adoption of evil practices did not lead to happiness for the Jaredites, but produced greater enmity, family strife, and eventual destruction. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>By drawing upon the words spoken by the Lord to Adam and Eve, Moroni shows how evil, when allowed to spread, breeds enmity, jealousy, and division in people, families, and nations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how the gospel of Jesus Christ can help us to act in ways that eliminate evil and other sources of contention from our lives.
