The first time Abinadi preached to the people of King Noah, he prophesied that if they did not repent, they would be brought into bondage. His words evoke those of the Lord to Moses, during his call to deliver Israel out of Egypt (Exodus 3:7-9, 16-17), but are used in a way that conveys a dramatic reversal of the Exodus for Noah’s people (Mosiah 11:20). The Lord told Moses, "I have <b><i>seen</i></b> the affliction of my people," "<b><i>seen</i></b> the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them," and "<b><i>seen</i></b> that which is done to you in Egypt." Through Abinadi, however, the Lord offers a negative variation of these words to Noah and his people: "I have <b><i>seen</i></b> their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms" (Mosiah 11:20; also compare what the Lord says of Jerusalem in 1 Nephi 1:13 and Jeremiah 13:27). <br><br>
The Lord told Moses He had "<b><i>heard</i></b> their cry by reason of their taskmasters" and would come down "to <b><i>deliver them out</i></b> of the hand of the Egyptians." The Lord told Noah and his people that He would "<b><i>deliver them into</i></b> the hands of their enemies" and that they would be "brought <b><i>into</i></b> bondage" (Mosiah 11:21). In contrast to Israel in Egypt, "I will be <b><i>slow to hear</i></b> their cries" and "I <b><i>will not hear</i></b> their prayers, <b><i>neither will I deliver them out</i></b> of their afflictions," unless they repent (Mosiah 11:24-25). The Lord told Moses and Israel, "I have surely <b><i>visited</i></b> you" to deliver them from Egypt. The Lord told Abinadi, "I will <b><i>visit</i></b> them in mine anger" (Mosiah 11:20). <br><br>
God said to ancient Israel, "ye shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord your God"</i></b> (Exodus 6:7). Of Noah and his people, He said, "they shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord their God"</i></b> (Mosiah 11:22). When the Lord gave the ten commandments, He warned, "I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquity</i></b> of the fathers upon the children" (Exodus 20:5). To Noah’s people, He said, "they shall know that I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquities</i></b> of my people" (Mosiah 11:22). <br><br>
Noah’s words, "<b><i>Who</i></b> is Abinadi that I and my people should be <b><i>judged</i></b> of him?" (Mosiah 11:27), echo those of the ungrateful Israelite who asked Moses, "<b><i>Who</i></b> madest thee a prince and a <b><i>judge</i></b> over us?" (Exodus 2:14). When King Noah asks, "<b><i>Who is the Lord</i></b> that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?" (Mosiah 11:27), he is portrayed like Pharaoh, who asked, "<b><i>Who is the Lord,</i></b> that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?" (Exodus 5:2), and like Pharaoh, "<b><i>hardened</i></b> his heart" (Mosiah 11:29; compare Exodus 7:13). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The wickedness and sins of King Noah and his people are characterized in Abinadi’s prophecy as a form of bondage. Noah and his priests are placed in the roles of Pharaoh and the Egyptian taskmasters. The Exodus blessings are turned on their heads because of the rebellion of the Nephite colony and their leaders. As we read Abinadi’s words, we should ponder how our own sins and rebellion against God limit our happiness and opportunities to grow. If we turn to God, we increase our freedom and our ability to experience greater joy.
