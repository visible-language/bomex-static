At the birth of Christ, great signs were given to the people of Nephi; yet, in spite of these events, Mormon relates that many of the people fell back into unbelief and apostasy. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>They began to be <b>hard in their hearts,</b> and <b>blind</b> in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—<br><br>
Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did <b>blind</b> their eyes and <b>lead them away</b> to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing … <br><br>
And Satan did go about <b>leading away</b> the hearts of the people, <b>tempting</b> them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land</i> (3 Nephi 2:1-3).</p><br>
Like the mists of darkness, the adversary’s temptations hardened the hearts, blinded the eyes, and led away the people of Nephi into wickedness. Mormon’s language, borrowed from Nephi, emphasizes how the mists of darkness worked at this point in Nephite history. Temptations of the devil, left unchecked, can lead us to forget and dismiss even the greatest signs and miracles that have previously occurred in our lives.<br><br>
Mormon’s account underscores the need to hold fast to the word of God, making it a part of our daily life and behavior, even after we have experienced miraculous events and blessings in our lives. We must "watch," or always be alert for danger, and continue in sincere and daily prayer. We must never become careless in our faith and must strive to remember the Lord’s many mercies, lest we become as the Nephites of old.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>By adopting the words of Nephi earlier in his narrative, Mormon skillfully places the apostasy of the Nephites into the setting of Lehi’s dream and likens earlier scriptures to a new circumstance. Attentive readers of the Book of Mormon will benefit from noticing such allusions in the text. This account invites us to see ourselves in Lehi’s dream and use the wisdom found in the Book of Mormon. It will allow us to pass through the mists of darkness, designed to blind us to the joys of God’s love and lead us to misery and destruction. We can then partake of God’s love.
