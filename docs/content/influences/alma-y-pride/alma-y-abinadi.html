      Alma’s father, Alma I, had been one of King Noah’s priests at the time when Abinadi was brought before King Noah’s court. He was converted by Abinadi’s words and recorded Abinadi’s teachings and testimony (Mosiah 17:2; 18:1-3). When we examine the teachings of Alma II, we find evidence that he drew upon this record when counseling his troubled son, Corianton.<sup>1</sup>  <br><br>
While some of the words and phrases from Abinadi’s sermons can also be found in the writings of subsequent Book of Mormon speakers, others are only found in the writings of Alma. These include the warning that unless he repented, his sins would "stand as a testimony against [him] at the last day" (Mosiah 16:10; Alma 39:8), the phrase "they have no part" (Mosiah 15:26; Alma 40:13), the teaching that all will be "brought to stand before God" to be "judged . . . according to their works" (Mosiah 16:10; Alma 40:21), and a reference to a "first resurrection" (Mosiah 15:21; Alma 40:15-17). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Alma’s words show how the prophetic teachings of Abinadi, treasured and faithfully recorded by his father, became a blessing leading to the repentance of his son Corianton, and continues to bless readers today. When we read the words of Alma to Corianton, we should ponder how those teachings can help us to have greater faith in Christ, and build greater faith in the hearts of our families.
