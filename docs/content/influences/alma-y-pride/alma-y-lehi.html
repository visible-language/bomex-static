When Alma recounts his dramatic conversion to his son Helaman, he evokes the words of his ancestor Lehi’s visionary experience. Alma says, "Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, <b><i>God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God;</i></b> yea, and my soul did long to be there" (Alma 36:22). Alma specifically mentions Lehi’s experience, and his words precisely match those found in 1 Nephi 1:8. <br><br>
When Alma speaks of his post-conversion desire to diligently share the gospel message, he draws upon the language of Lehi’s vision of the tree of life. "I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to <b><i>taste</i></b> of the <b><i>exceeding joy</i></b> of which I did <b><i>taste"</i></b> (Alma 36:24). Alma’s words evoke Lehi’s description: "And as I <b><i>partook</i></b> of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with <b><i>exceeding great joy;</i></b> wherefore I began to be desirous that my family should <b><i>partake</i></b> of it also" (1 Nephi 8:12). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Alma’s words show a familiarity with Lehi’s teachings and indicate that he pondered the scriptures of his prophetic ancestor. When we read Alma’s words to his son Helaman, we should ponder how we can seek to see and hear and know what Alma experienced, which brought such exquisite joy into his life.
