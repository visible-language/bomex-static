In the final section of his account of the Jaredites, Moroni again points the reader to the subject of the Flood, which was a curse upon the wicked during the days of Noah. "For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the <b><i>waters</i></b> had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands" (Ether 13:2). The recession of the waters after the Flood was a blessing to Noah and his descendants, just as the Flood had been a curse. The rejection of the Jaredite prophet Ether indicates a return of the curse. <br><br>
Moroni then traces the final battles between Coriantumr, the last Jaredite king, and his enemies. Before the Flood, there were "<b><i>mighty men</i></b> . . . of old, men of renown" (Genesis 6:4). Three times, Moroni refers to "<b><i>mighty men"</i></b> in the final Jaredite war (Ether 13:15; 15:2, 26). The Genesis account states that the "waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth" and that all was "<b><i>covered"</i></b> (Genesis 7:19-20). Moroni evokes the Flood story in his description of the Jaredite destruction; but in this case, rather than water, "the whole face of the land was <b><i>covered</i></b> with the bodies of the dead" (Ether 14:21). <br><br>
The Lord had warned Noah, "<b><i>my Spirit shall not always strive with man"</i></b> (Genesis 6:3), and had warned the brother of Jared to "remember that <b><i>my Spirit will not always strive with man" </i></b>(Ether 2:15). Moroni writes concerning the Jaredites: "But behold, <b><i>the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them,</i></b> and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed" (Ether 15:19). <br><br>
The account in Genesis states that all but Noah and his family were destroyed in the Flood. "<b><i>And every living substance was destroyed</i></b> which was upon the face of the ground ... and they were <b><i>destroyed</i></b> from the earth; and <b><i>Noah only remained alive,</i></b> and they that were with him in the ark" (Genesis 7:23). In an ironic reversal of the Noah comparison, Coriantumr is cursed to be like Noah---a witness of total destruction. Ether prophesied that if he and his household would repent, they would be spared; "otherwise they should be <b><i>destroyed,</i></b> and all his household <b><i>save it were himself</i></b>.... And <b><i>every living soul should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr"</i></b> (Ether 13:21). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Moroni’s selection of language shows that the story of Noah and the Flood lies behind much of his description of the Jaredite destruction. This helps the reader to more fully appreciate Moroni’s message and purpose, which is to persuade the reader to believe in Christ and repent to avoid similar destruction. As we study the account of the destruction of the Jaredites, we should ponder how the teachings and doctrine of Christ can lead us on a secure path that will bring us greater happiness.
