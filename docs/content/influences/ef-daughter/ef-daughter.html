The account of the Garden in Genesis states that "<b><i>the serpent</i></b> was <b><i>more subtle</i></b> than any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had made" (Genesis 3:1). The word that the King James translation renders as "subtle" more accurately means "crafty" or "cunning," as reflected in more recent translations, such as the New Revised Standard Version. <br><br>
Moroni, in his account of the Jaredites, says that the daughter of Jared was "exceedingly expert" (Ether 8:8). The word "expert" has the connotation of being skilled, clever, experienced, and knowing how to get things done. The wording invites the reader to compare the daughter of Jared to the serpent who enticed Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit, bringing death into the world. In Moroni’s account, Jared’s wicked daughter is the agent who introduces a deadly evil into Jaredite society. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Jared’s daughter inspired her wicked father to form a murderous secret combination to overthrow the kingdom of his father Omer. Moroni’s use of the words "exceedingly expert" suggests that she was knowledgeable and clever; but she used these skills to introduce an evil plan among the people. Moroni’s account shows how skills and cleverness without righteousness can be used in ways that lead to misery and awful consequences within families and society. As we read this account, we should ponder how we can use the talents and abilities the Lord has given us for good and not evil purposes.
