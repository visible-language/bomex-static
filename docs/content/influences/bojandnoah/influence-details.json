Also, God is described as making a covenant with both men relating to the future destruction of man (Genesis 9:8i17; Ether 2:8i12). Similar wording in both the Genesis story and the Jaredite account suggest that Moroni’s choice of language was intentionally designed to draw this connection to the attention of the reader.",
