His longer account on the large plates of Nephi contains a more detailed account of the wickedness he witnessed, leading up to the final destruction of the Nephites as a people (Mormon 2:18; 4:11). While Mormon does not provide great detail about the wickedness of his people, he does underscore the fallen state of his people by alluding to one of the most wicked points in biblical history: the time preceding the Flood in the days of Noah. <br><br>
At the time of wickedness before the Flood, Noah and his family were blessed by God. "But Noah found <b><i>grace</i></b> in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8). Mormon lamented the wickedness of his unrepentant people and wrote, "I saw that the day of <b><i>grace</i></b> was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually" (Mormon 2:15). Unlike Noah and his family, the Nephites would not be spared destruction, because of their unwillingness to repent and return to God.<br><br>
In Genesis, "God saw that the <b><i>wickedness</i></b> of man was <b><i>great</i></b> in the earth" (Genesis 6:5) and "the earth was filled with violence" (Genesis 6:11, 13). Mormon wrote, "And there never had been so <b><i>great wickedness,</i></b> among all the children of Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel, according to the words of the Lord, as was among this people" (Mormon 4:12). Mormon also notes the violence that pervaded his own society (Mormon 4:11). <br><br>
The wickedness before the Flood enveloped all aspects of society and man and "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only <b><i>evil continually"</i></b> (Genesis 6:5). Mormon describes the Nephites in similar terms. His people "repented not of the <b><i>evil</i></b> they had done but persisted in their wickedness <b><i>continually"</i></b> (Mormon 4:10), and "every heart was hardened, so that they delighted in the shedding of blood <b><i>continually"</i></b> (Mormon 4:11).  <br><br>
Before the Flood, the Lord warned, "My <b><i>spirit</i></b> shall not always <b><i>strive</i></b> with man" (Genesis 6:3). When the Spirit ceased to strive with those in Noah’s day, they were destroyed. Mormon pointedly evokes that earlier period when he wrote, "the <b><i>Spirit</i></b> of the Lord hath already ceased to <b><i>strive</i></b> with their fathers" (Mormon 5:16), language that highlights the wickedness that prevailed among the Nephites in his time.<br><br>
When mankind refused to repent, the Lord told Noah, "I will <b><i>destroy</i></b> man whom I have created <b><i>from the face of the earth"</i></b> (Genesis 6:7). After the Nephites refused to repent and swore in vengeance to utterly destroy the Lamanites, the Lord said the Nephites "shall be <b><i>cut off from the face of the earth"</i></b> (Mormon 3:15).<br><br>
