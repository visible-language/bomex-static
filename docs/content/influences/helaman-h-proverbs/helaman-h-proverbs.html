Helaman, son of Helaman, counseled his sons, Nephi and Lehi, about the importance of keeping the "commandments" and how the "names" that he had given them could help them "remember" the righteousness of their ancestors and to also "remember" the Lord. He taught them to lay up "treasure" in heaven and seek the gift of eternal "life." Helaman also counseled his sons to build upon the sure "foundation" of Christ, so that when the "whirlwind" came, they would not "fall."  <br><br>
Helaman’s fatherly words of counsel to his righteous sons may have been influenced by the teachings in Proverbs Chapter 10. This section of the book is attributed to Solomon, and would likely have been recorded on the plates of brass (See the chart below.). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Helaman’s words show how, as a father, he drew upon the wisdom of scriptural proverbs to teach his sons how to live righteous lives. He adapted these teachings in a way that would encourage his sons to build upon the foundation of Christ, rather than on other things that would not last. As we read Helaman’s words of counsel, we should ponder how we can use scriptural wisdom to encourage our own children to build upon that eternal foundation.
