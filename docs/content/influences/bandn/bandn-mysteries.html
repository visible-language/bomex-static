King Benjamin taught his sons that, without the plates of brass, "we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the <b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:3), while having these plates allowed them to "read and understand his <b><i>mysteries" </i></b>(Mosiah 1:5). Earlier prophets also refer to the mysteries of God. Nephi spoke of "having had a great knowledge of the <b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> (1 Nephi 1:1), and his brother Jacob spoke of God’s "<b><i>mysteries"</i></b> (Jacob 4:8). Benjamin, however, specifically links a knowledge of the mysteries of God with the written word that he had in his possession. The prophet Alma, several generations later, spoke of mysteries contained on the plates of brass (Alma 37:4). Only Benjamin, however, uses the words "<b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> in reference to the content on the plates of brass.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s teaching that a knowledge of the mysteries of God could be found on the brass plates, helps us to understand the value of the scriptures, which constitute a spiritual memory. They are a gateway to revelation and, without them, we are blind. Had they not been recorded, we would be unable to pass them down to future generations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder what mysteries we need to know in our own lives, diligently seek them, and strive to be worthy and ready to receive them.
