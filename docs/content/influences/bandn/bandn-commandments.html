During his mission to obtain the plates of brass, Nephi says, "I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall <b><i>keep my commandments,</i></b> they shall <b><i>prosper in the land</i></b> of promise. Yea, and I also thought that <b><i>they could not keep the commandments</i></b> of the Lord, according to the law of Moses, <b><i>save they should have the law.</i></b> And I also knew that <b><i>the law was engraven upon the plates</i></b> of brass (1 Nephi 4:14-16). After successfully obtaining the record, he observed, "We could <b><i>preserve the commandments of the Lord</i></b> unto our children (1 Nephi 5:21). <br><br>
King Benjamin taught his sons, "I would that ye should remember that <b><i>were it not for these plates,</i></b> which contain these records and these <b><i>commandments,</i></b> we must have suffered in ignorance" (Mosiah 1:3). "<b><i>For it were not possible</i></b> that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, <b><i>except it were for the help of these plates"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:4). He also reminded them of the importance of those scriptures "which have been kept and <b><i>preserved</></b> by the hand of God," which enabled them to "<b><i>have his commandments"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:5) and "<b><i>keep the commandments of God,</i></b> that [they might] <b><i>prosper in the land"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:7). Both prophets emphasized that knowing and keeping the commandments would have been impossible, if the record had not been preserved.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Without written scriptures, the people of Lehi would have not been able to preserve a knowledge of the commandments, but would have had the same problem experienced by the people of Zarahemla who, because of their lack of records, "denied the being of their Creator" (Omni 1:17). As we read the teachings of Benjamin to his sons, we should consider how we can effectively preserve and internalize a knowledge of the commandments in our own families.
