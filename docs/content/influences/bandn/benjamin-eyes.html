King Benjamin taught his sons how the records on the plates of brass enabled them to have the Lord’s commandments always "before our eyes," and that if this had not been the case, "even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief" (Mosiah 1:5). He then reaffirmed to them that those records were true "and we can know of their surety because we have them <b><i>before our eyes"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:6). Only King Benjamin uses this phrase, and he emphasized to his sons that this was something they were to "remember" (Mosiah 1:5-6). It is interesting that Benjamin links having the commandments in the scriptures <b><i>before our eyes</i></b> with knowing that those words are true. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s teachings show that the Lord’s commandments light the way for us. However, where a record of those commandments is missing, future generations become blind, dwindle in unbelief, and fail in their potential for good. When the people of Nephi kept the Lord’s words before their eyes, they remembered God and prospered in their ways. They could thereby know the truth of his words from day to day, as they were continually reminded of it, lived it, and loved the truth as the foundation of their peace. <br><br>
As we read Benjamin’s words, we should ask ourselves how we can always keep the Lord’s words "before our eyes" so that the words of Christ can penetrate our hearts and provide daily light, as we walk in the covenant path.
