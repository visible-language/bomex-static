The account of the Fall of Man in the Book of Moses provides additional words that are not found in the Genesis story. The Moses account states, "And Satan <b><i>put it into the heart</i></b> of the serpent, (for he had drawn away many after him,) ... for he knew not the mind of God, wherefore he sought to <b><i>destroy the world"</i></b> (Moses 4:6). Although the plan of our Heavenly Father prepared a way for our redemption from transgression, the Moses account explains that the goal of the devil in bringing a knowledge of evil into the world was to destroy man by causing him to rebel against God and His commandments. <br><br>
In his account in the book of Ether, Moroni explains how secret combinations were introduced among the Jaredites. He states that, "It was the daughter of Jared who <b><i>put it into his heart</i></b> to search up these things of old; and Jared <b><i>put it into the heart</i></b> of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired" (Ether 8:17). The Moses account shows a transmission from Satan to the serpent, and from the serpent to Eve and Adam---leading to transgression and death. <br><br>
In Ether, evil knowledge is transmitted from Jared’s daughter to her father, and then to Akish, who brings the evil and murderous plan to fruition. Notably, as with the event in the garden, this leads to the death of Jared, and Akish, and their kingdom (Ether 8:21; 9:12). This great destruction was brought about when this series of individuals allowed evil to be put into their hearts. In contrast to the followers of Akish, the righteous King Omer and those who followed him were protected and preserved from the wicked plans of their enemies.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Moroni’s words tie the Ether story to the Fall of Man to emphasize the dangers of allowing evil things to enter and remain in one’s heart. By refusing to allow such things to remain and have place in our hearts and minds, we can avoid what happened to the Jaredites. As we read the account in Ether, we should ponder how the gospel of Jesus Christ and its sacred covenants can strengthen and protect us from agents of the adversary, who strive to put things into our hearts that can destroy our peace and happiness. We can then live the gospel and keep the covenants to access that strength and protection.
