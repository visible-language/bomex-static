Alma taught his son Helaman that God commanded the small plates of Nephi to be kept “for a wise purpose in him” (Alma 37:14, 18), which is the precise phrase used by Nephi (1 Nephi 9:5; 19:3). Alma also refers to the “plates of brass,” which contain “the genealogy of our forefathers” (Alma 37:3; 1 Nephi 5:14, 16), and references Lehi’s prophecy that those plates would eventually “go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people” (Alma 37:4; 1 Nephi 5:17–18). Alma also admonishes his son that he must care for the plates so that they may “retain their brightness” (Alma 37:5). Lehi had prophesied that the plates of brass would not “be dimmed any more by time” (1 Nephi 5:19). <br><br>
Alma refers to the Liahona as a “ball” and as a “compass” that was “prepared” by the Lord (Alma 37:38), just as Nephi does (2 Nephi 5:12). Both prophets speak of its “curious workmanship” (Alma 37:39; 1 Nephi 16:10) and that it worked “according to their faith” (Alma 37:40; 1 Nephi 16:28), but that it “ceased” to work without faith (Alma 37:41; 1 Nephi 18:12–13). They added that through “small means” the Lord showed great things (Alma 37:41; 1 Nephi 16:29). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Alma’s teachings show that he was very familiar with the teachings of Nephi on the small plates, and they greatly influenced what he taught his son. When we read the words of Alma to Helaman, we should remember that the Lord fulfills His promises to His people, including us. We should always seek to exercise faith in Christ to qualify to receive His blessings. The Lord can use our weak and seemingly small acts of faith to fulfill His divine purposes and to bless our lives and the lives of others.
