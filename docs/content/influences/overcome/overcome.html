Although the words "overcome" and "carried away" are each used by some speakers in the Book of Mormon, they only appear together in three passages in the text. The first time they appear is in the vision of Lehi, where the prophet is given a vision of the throne of God and receives his prophetic call. "And being thus <b><i>overcome</i></b> with the Spirit, he was <b><i>carried away</i></b> in a vision" (1 Nephi 1:8). This experience brought him joy, "for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him" (1 Nephi 1:15). The things that he saw and heard "manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world" (1 Nephi 1:19). <br><br>
The second time these words are used are by Lehi’s son Nephi, who also had a vision of the coming of Christ and the future. Nephi says that he "had been <b><i>carried away</i></b> in the Spirit" (1 Nephi 15:1) and "was <b><i>overcome</i></b> because of my afflictions," in learning that his future posterity would be destroyed because of their wickedness (1 Nephi 15:5). <br><br>
The third time these words appear together is in the account of the miraculous conversion of King Lamoni. Mormon records that the knowledge of the gospel and the blessing of repentance "infused such joy into his soul" that "[it] had <b><i>overcome</i></b> his natural frame, and he was <b><i>carried away</i></b> in God" (Alma 19:6). When he arose again, he reported, "I have seen my Redeemer" and learned that "he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name" (Alma 19:13). <br><br>
Although the words "overcome" and "carried away" are found in the descriptions of the experiences of Lehi, Nephi, and Lamoni, Lamoni’s experience of being carried away and overcome more closely echoes Lehi’s experience, rather than Nephi’s. In contrast to Nephi, both Lehi and Lamoni are overcome with joy, rather than sorrow.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>The conversion of Lamoni and the Lamanites was a fulfillment of the earnest hope of Father Lehi, that the seed of his rebellious sons would one day be blessed and converted, a hope that was not realized in his lifetime. The words "overcome" and "carried away" in the description of the experiences of Lehi and Lamoni remind us of the blessings of the covenants God makes with His people. He does not forget us, but He will remember and bless us and our children from generation to generation.
