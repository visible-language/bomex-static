One of the ways that the writings of prophets help us is to draw our attention to other stories from the scriptures, which support, strengthen, and encourage us to act with faith and do what those prophets teach that we should do. One example of this can be found in Moroni’s abridgment of the record of Ether. Moroni’s selection of words in this account of the Jaredites points the reader to similar language in the story of the Flood. Evidence for this can be seen in the following examples, which include <i>The Brother of Jared and Noah, Secret Combinations and the Flood,</i> and <i>Jaredite Destruction and the Flood.</i> <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Noah was a righteous man whom God blessed with sacred covenants. These covenant blessings helped him to preserve his family in difficult times, and escape the corrosive and deadly flood of wickedness that surrounded them. Similar influences and agencies surround us today. Moroni helps us to see ourselves in the story of the Jaredites and ponder how we can do better and be happier. As we read the book of Ether, we should ponder what we can do to increase the covenant blessings in our lives.
