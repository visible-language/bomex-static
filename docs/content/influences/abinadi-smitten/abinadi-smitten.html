Abinadi’s words on his second mission to Noah and his people draws upon the language in Exodus, in which the Lord smote the Egyptians with various plagues. The Lord warned the unrepentant Noah, like the recalcitrant Pharaoh (Exodus 7:5; 14:4, 18), that he "<b><i>shall know that I am the Lord"</i></b> (Mosiah 12:3). God told Pharaoh, "I will stretch out my hand, that I may <b><i>smite thee and thy people with pestilence;</i></b> and thou shalt be <b><i>cut off from the earth"</i></b> (Exodus 9:14-15). The Lord told Noah’s people, "I will <b><i>smite this my people</i></b> with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with <b><i>pestilence"</i></b> and that, "except they repent I will <b><i>utterly destroy them"</i></b> (Mosiah 12:4, 7-8). Both groups were smitten with "<b><i>hail"</i></b> (Exodus 9:22; Mosiah 12:6), the "<b><i>east wind,"</i></b> and insects that would "pester their land . . . and devour their grain" (Mosiah 12:6; Exodus 8:16-24). <br><br> 
A second notable connection is when Moses took ashes from the furnace, sprinkled them toward heaven, and the Egyptians were cursed with boils and blains (Exodus 9:10). Israel, however, was promised that if they would diligently hearken to God, "I will put none of these <b><i>diseases</i></b> upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee" (Exodus 15:26; see also Deuteronomy 28:60). When Abinadi is suffering death by fire he tells the priests, "<b><i>ye</i></b> shall be afflicted with all manner of <b><i>diseases</i></b> because of your iniquities" (Mosiah 17:14-16). <br><br>
Abinadi taught Noah and his priests from the words of Isaiah, which explained that Christ would suffer and bear the transgressions of his people (those who hearken) and makes "intercession" for them. Significantly, Noah’s priests, who rejected Christ, who was familiar with man’s infirmities and sicknesses (Isaiah 53:3-4; Mosiah 14:3-4), are "smitten with all manner of diseases because of their iniquities" (Mosiah 17:16).
<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>When Noah and his people rejected Abinadi’s prophetic warning and refused to repent, they were smitten like the Egyptians and Pharaoh, who hardened their hearts against the Lord and Moses. Their lives became increasingly worse to the degree that they rebelled against God. When we read Abinadi’s words, we should ponder how daily repentance and following the counsel of living prophets and apostles can increase the blessings in our lives. Having carried our sorrows and infirmities, our Savior is always ready to bless us with healing and love, as soon as we are willing to turn to Him.
