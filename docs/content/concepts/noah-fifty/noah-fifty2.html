In his account of the wicked king Noah, Mormon tells how Noah’s people boasted in their own power, after a great victory over the Lamanites. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now because of this great victory they were lifted up in the pride of their hearts; they did boast in their own strength, saying that their <b>fifty</b> could stand against <b>thousands</b> of Lamanites </i>(Mosiah 11:19).</p><br>
By drawing upon words from the story of Laban and Lehi’s sons, Mormon places Noah in the role of Laban, and his people in the role of Laban’s fifty. The implication is that Noah and his "fifty" will be destroyed if they do not repent. <br><br>
Nephi also told his brothers that the Lord was able to <b><i>deliver</i></b> them and destroy the powerful Laban (1 Nephi 4:3). After Noah’s people boasted of their victory, the Lord, through his prophet Abinadi, warned them that if they did not repent, he would "<b><i>deliver</i></b> them <b><i>into</i></b> the hands of their enemies" (Mosiah 11:21).<sup>1</sup>  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Mormon uses Nephi’s words to highlight the pride and wickedness of Noah and his unrepentant people, who were like Laban and the wicked of Jerusalem. While they boasted of their own power and abilities, they would face bondage and destruction unless they repented, and sought and depended upon their Lord’s strength. This shows us that we must always remember and acknowledge the Lord’s blessings in our lives and remain humble, lest we become like the Nephites of old (D&C 38:39).

<sup>1</sup>  Laban was slain while drunk (1 Nephi 4:7, 18). Noah was a wine bibber (Mosiah 11:15). Like Laban, Noah would not keep the commandments (1 Nephi 4:11; Mosiah 11:2) and rejected the words of Abinadi (Mosiah 17:12), just as Laban had rejected the word of the Lord (1 Nephi 4:11).
