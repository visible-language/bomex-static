When Ammon's brother Aaron asked Lamoni's father, "<b><i>Believest</i></b> thou that <b><i>there is a God</i></b>?" Lamoni's father responded, "If now thou sayest there is a God, behold <b><i>I will believe"</i></b> (Alma 22:7). Then the king asked, "Is God that <b><i>Great Spirit</i></b>?" which Aaron affirmed. <br><br>
Ammon and Aaron's clarification, linking "God" to the Lamanite conception of the "Great Spirit," was somewhat of a breakthrough in the Lamanite understanding, upon which Lamanite converts could build a growing understanding of the gospel. The few words of king Anti-Nephi-Lehi suggest that the Lamanite converts continued to substitute "Great God" for "Great Spirit." He speaks of "my God" (Alma 24:7, 9-10), "our God" (Alma 24:15-16), "my <b><i>great God"</i></b> (Alma 24:8, 10), "the <b><i>great God"</i></b> (Alma 24:14), and Jesus as the "Son of our <b><i>great God"</i></b> (Alma 24:13).<br><br>
Lamoni testified to his father that Ammon and his brethren were "holy prophets of the <b><i>true God"</i></b> (Alma 20:15), reflecting the contrast between his new understanding of Deity and his earlier false views. Interestingly, Samuel the Lamanite might have been reflecting on his own cultural background when he combined this later idea with the revised understanding of a Great Spirit, in his title for God as "<b><i>our great</i></b> and <b><i>true God"</i></b> (Helaman 13:18).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Like effective missionaries build on their investigators' positive ideas to bring the perspective of the gospel into their lives, we can build on common ground to communicate with our friends and families, and preach the gospel by our example.
