<b>Helaman 3:27-30</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in 
the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.  <br><br>
Yea, <b>thus we see</b> that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who 
will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.  <br><br>
Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and 
powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of 
the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that 
everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked--- <br><br>
And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the 
kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all 
our holy fathers, to go no more out. </i></p><br>
Mormon recounts how the Lord blessed the Nephites so abundantly at one time that even 
the Church leaders were "astonished beyond measure" at the number of conversions to 
the Church of God (Helaman 3:25). There is a dangerous gulf of misery that is ready to 
swallow up the human family. However, the gospel of Christ in the Lord’s plan of mercy 
has power to cut through all of the snares of the devil and lead men and women across 
that abyss to sit down in peace with the Saints "to go no more out;" but only if they 
choose to lay hold upon the word of God. <br><br>
<b>Helaman 6:34-36, 40 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in 
unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow 
exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes 
and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him. <br><br> 
<b>And thus we see</b> that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the 
Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.  <br><br>
<b>And thus we see</b> that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, 
because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words ’  <br><br>
<b>And thus we see</b> that [the Nephites] were in an awful state, and ripening for an 
everlasting destruction. </i></p><br>
The phrase "thus we see" appears more times in Helaman Chapter 6 than in any other 
chapter of the Book of Mormon. Mormon charts the apostasy of the Nephites during a 
time of great prosperity, due to the tempting influence of secret combinations to get 
gain. The contrast between the Nephites, who are usually presumed to be more faithful, 
and the Lamanites, who are usually associated with wickedness and unbelief, is 
striking, as traditional assumptions about each group are turned on their heads. The 
Nephites have become largely impenitent and the Lamanites are humble and faithful to 
the covenant.  <br><br>
Mormon explains the reason for the new trajectory of behavior. The Nephite wickedness 
is due the "hardness of their hearts;" that is, their unwillingness to heed and follow 
the Lord’s teachings because they yielded to the flashy but fleeting temptations from 
the Gadiantons, "having come down to believe in their works, and partake of their spoils" (Helaman 6:38), actions that place them on a path to destruction. The key to 
Lamanite peace and happiness was "their easiness and willingness to believe" in the 
Lord’s words, which caused them to "grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God." 
Mormon encourages his readers to cultivate the same willingness. <br><br>
<b>Helaman 12:3</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see </b>that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, 
yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with 
all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.</i></p><br>
Here, Mormon’s "thus we see" appears after he has shown several examples of the 
Nephites’ rapid return to apostasy, even after experiencing great examples of the 
Lord’s power and mercy. It was often at the very time when the Lord was blessing the 
Nephites that they began to take His blessings for granted and fell back into 
disobedience and works of darkness (Helaman 12:1-2). Mormon’s lesson shows the 
importance of gratitude and daily remembrance of His kindness and mercy. As we 
remember each day the many ways that the Lord has blessed us and evaluate how we are 
showing our love for Him, we can avoid becoming like the Nephites of old.  <br><br> 
<b>Ether 14:24 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his wrath, and their 
wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for their everlasting destruction. </i></p><br>
In his description of the destruction of the Jaredites, Moroni highlights the self-
destructive nature of sin and rebellion against God. The Lord’s commandments provide 
physical and spiritual safety. Sin and abomination often create the very traps that 
will destroy us if we persist in wrongdoing. <br><br>
