These include King Lamoni, his father, and King Anti-Nephi-Lehi. Lamoni was king over the people in the land of Ishmael and a descendant of Ishmael (Alma 17:19, 21). At this time, Lamoni's father was king over all the Lamanites in the land of Nephi. When Lamoni's father died, his son Anti-Nephi-Lehi became king.",
