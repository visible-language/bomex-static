The Nephite missionaries benefited from the prophetic teachings recorded on the plates of Nephi (Alma 37:9). Lehi taught his son Jacob, "No flesh . . . can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the <b><i>merits</i></b>, and mercy, and grace <b><i>of the Holy Messiah"</i></b> (2 Nephi 2:8). Aaron taught king Lamoni’s father that "since man had fallen he <b><i>could not merit anything of himself;</i></b> but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth" (Alma 22:14). <br><br>
This central teaching introduced to the Lamanites by Nephite missionaries is reflected in the words of subsequent Lamanite converts. King Anti-Nephi-Lehi reminded his people that God had "taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the <b><i>merits of his Son"</i></b> (Alma 24:10). It is interesting that this inspired teaching is also found in the words of Samuel the Lamanite, who taught the Nephites that those who believed on the name of Christ might "have a remission of [their sins] through <b><i>his merits"</i></b> (Helaman 14:13). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Coming from a culture where violence, bloodshed, and many other abominable practices were the traditional norm, and were deeply ingrained into their way of life, the doctrine that one’s very nature could be changed through faith in the Messiah and the merits of His life and sacrifice would have been a powerful doctrine for those who thought of themselves as the least worthy of redemption. When we read the account of the Lamanite conversions, we should ponder the power, strength, and holiness that a knowledge of Christ’s redemption can bring to our lives as we strive to love and serve Him.
