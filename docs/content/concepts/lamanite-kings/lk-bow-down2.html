It is difficult to adequately express the significance of this event for the people of Lehi. At the commencement of his record, Nephi wrote with sadness that Laman and Lemuel "<b><i>knew not</i></b> the dealings of the <b><i>God</i></b> who created them" (1 Nephi 2:12) and would not inquire of God because they assumed, "the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us" (1 Nephi 15:9). Yet in the account of one of their royal descendants, this powerful king of all the Lamanites <b><i>bows down</i></b> and offers all, including his sins, in order to <b><i>know God!</i></b>  <br><br>
According to Alma, it was the records on the plates of Nephi, which described "the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael" (Alma 18:38), but also the doctrine of Christ and his redemption (Alma 18:39-41; 22:13-14), which gave these Lamanite leaders and their people the hope and faith needed to seek and partake of the very blessings that their fathers had once rejected.  <br><br>
As we read about the success of the Nephite missionaries, we should strive to follow the example of this Lamanite king, and come to know God better each day by bowing down in prayer before Him.
