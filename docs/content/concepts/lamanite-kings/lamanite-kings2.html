We, of course, do not have a full account of all the teachings of the sons of Mosiah among the Lamanites; however, there is evidence in the selection of words we do have, of the truthfulness of Alma’s observation that the words and ideas that the missionaries taught were incorporated into the language of these Lamanite kings. Consider the following ideas: 
<ol>
<li> God is a Great Spirit,</li>
<li> The idea that a portion of the Spirit of God can dwell within the righteous,</li>
<li> The teaching that salvation from even the most awful sins is possible through the merits of the Son of God, and </li>
<li> The practice of bowing down before God. </li>
</ol>
Each of these is discussed in a separate cameo.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>A comparison of the teachings of the Nephite missionaries with the language used by the converted Lamanite kings demonstrates the impact of the words of the Nephite missionaries on those they taught. When we read the story of Ammon, his brethren, and their missionary activities, we should ponder the impact of their words, and how those words could lead to such a mighty change in the hearts of those who responded to them. Can we experience such a mighty change in our hearts?
