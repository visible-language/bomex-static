  "description": "Sariah was the wife of Lehi and the faithful mother of six sons and at least two daughters. She lived in Jerusalem with her family and departed Jerusalem with her husband, when he was warned of God that his life was in danger. While at their camp in the Valley of Lemuel, when her sons were sent up to Jerusalem to obtain the plates of brass, Sariah, fearing for their lives, initially murmured against her husband. When they returned, she bore testimony of the Lord's blessings and her husband's prophetic call. \n\nWhile traveling through the wilderness, she gave birth to two sons, Jacob and Joseph. During the family's journey crossing the ocean, Sariah suffered greatly due to the rebellious actions of Laman and Lemuel, and she and her husband nearly died. She died sometime after their arrival in the land of promise.",
