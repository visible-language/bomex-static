When Sariah murmured against her husband, she called him a "visionary man" and
complained that he had led them into the wilderness, where she feared they
might perish. The term "visionary man," a term Laman and Lemuel also applied
to their father, is noteworthy (1 Nephi 2:11).<br><br> Sariah’s
contemporary, Jeremiah, warned of false prophets who gave false dreams and who
spoke "after the vision of their own heart" (Jeremiah 23:16). Unlike Jeremiah,
the false prophets proclaimed peace and did not believe that Jerusalem would
be destroyed. Jeremiah taught that true prophets, like himself, in contrast to
false prophets, had actually stood in the Lord’s heavenly council where they
had received their message directly from God (Jeremiah 23:18, 21-22).
<br><br> Lehi’s words, responding to his wife’s complaint, reflect the
context of Jeremiah’s prophecy when he says, "I know that I am a visionary
man; for if I had not <b>seen the things of God in a vision</b> I should not
have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished
with my brethren" (1 Nephi 5:4). Lehi, unlike the false prophets of his day,
had actually seen a true vision and had, in fact, met the criteria given by
Jeremiah to have stood in the Lord’s heavenly council to receive the prophetic
word (1 Nephi 1:8-15, 18-19). He had faithfully declared that message and then
fled Jerusalem because the Lord commanded him to do so. This obedience brought
protection. <br><br> Sariah’s words fit into the context of Jeremiah’s day, and Lehi’s gentle response to her concerns shows how the guiding words of prophets bring comfort and assurance, and can help us distinguish the true prophets from those who are not.
