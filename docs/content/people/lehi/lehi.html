In addition to the fruit of the tree of life, which he saw in his vision, Lehi’s words also focus on his own fruit---his seed, his sons, and children are favored topics. He is interested in blessings, and his teachings and prophecies center around the covenants God made with the house of Israel and with him. <br><br>
Lehi is the only speaker in the Book of Mormon to use the word "opposition" (4). <br><br>
Throughout his life, Lehi experienced hard blows. The demands of his calling required that he abandon his ancestral lands of inheritance and most of his possessions. He experienced years of danger, affliction, and hunger (1 Nephi 16:19-32), and the death of friends (1 Nephi 16:34-35). The frequent rebellions of Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael took their toll and, on at least one occasion, nearly overwhelmed him (1 Nephi 18:17-18). He also recognized the blessings his family had received and how merciful the Lord had been (2 Nephi 1:1-2).  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Lehi suffered many afflictions and experienced deep sorrow from the rebellion and wickedness of Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael. However, the knowledge of his Redeemer and the blessings of obedience brought him great joy, allowing him to be "encircled about eternally in the arms of his [Redeemer’s] love" (2 Nephi 1:15).  <br><br>
Lehi’s words teach us that the Lord has the power to redeem us; to bring us through the darkness that sometimes envelops and confuses us, back to the warm embrace of His love. As we read Lehi’s words, we should ponder how often the Lord blessed him and his family, even when their lives were hard. This will help us to recognize how often he blesses each of us, including in challenging times.
