Lehi is the only Book of Mormon prophet to use the term "Mediator," which he does twice in one of his final sermons to his family. This may reflect his family situation in his later life, which included so much strife between his children and their families. Such conflict would have required him as a father and leader to mediate, sometimes unsuccessfully, between rival interests between his sons. In light of this, it may be significant that he taught his children, shortly before his death, to look toward their Divine Redeemer, "the great Mediator of all men" (2 Nephi 2:27-28). <br><br>
Lehi counseled his sons to choose to look to the "great Mediator of all men," rather than choose to be subject to "the captivity and power of the devil" (2 Nephi 2:27). He taught them that they did so when they hearkened to the great Mediator’s words and kept his commandments, which lead to liberty and eternal life (2 Nephi 2:28). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
When we experience injustice and harm from others, it is easy to become bitter. Our captivity to bitterness can be crippling to our happiness, peace, and positive relationships with others. By looking to Jesus Christ, our great Mediator, and keeping his commandments, we can find liberty from much of the strife and inner turmoil that we experience. He knows how to comfort us, strengthen us, and give us power to forgive those who may have offended us. We thereby become true disciples of Christ, and we can know that our Mediator is also our friend.
