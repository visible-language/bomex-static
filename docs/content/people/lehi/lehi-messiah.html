The word "Messiah" only appears twice in the King James translation of the Hebrew Bible (Daniel 9:25-26). Lehi is the first Book of Mormon prophet to teach about the Messiah. This term is also used by other early Nephite writers, such as Nephi, Jacob, and Jarom, but is only found twice outside the small plates. This indicates that it was a term used by early prophets in the text, rather than later ones. Only Lehi, however, uses the words "Holy Messiah" (2 Nephi 2:8). This divine title enhances our understanding of the nature and role of Christ. <br><br>
It may be significant that Lehi uses the term "Holy Messiah" in a blessing given to his son Jacob. Lehi blessed Jacob that his days would be "spent in the service of thy God" (2 Nephi 2:3). Jacob subsequently became a priest during the reign of his brother Nephi (2 Nephi 5:26).  <br><br>
Holiness was a particularly important principle for priests who officiated in the temple in ancient Israel; the temple was holy and represented the presence of God. Just as the animals that were offered in sacrifice needed to be without blemish, so the Messiah who gave his life needed to be holy for his sacrifice to be acceptable. It is only through the Holy Messiah that all can be made holy. <br><br>

The only way to become holy is "through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah" (2 Nephi 2:8). He is our Redeemer and is "full of grace and truth" (2 Nephi 2:6). By obeying the truth set forth in his words, counsel, and commandments, we can receive power and strength to do better. Through the gift of the Holy Ghost, we can be sanctified.
