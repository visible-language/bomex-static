      When he preached to the wicked in Ammonihah, Amulek warned, "If the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would <i>be ripe for destruction</i>.... But it is by the prayers of the <i>righteous</i> that ye are <i>spared;</i> now therefore, if ye will <i>cast out the righteous from among you</i> then will not the Lord stay his hand" (Alma 10:19, 23). Samuel paraphrases Amulek’s words when he tells the people of Zarahemla, "It is for the <i>righteous’</i> sake that it is <i>spared.</i> But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall <i>cast out the righteous from among you,</i> then shall ye <i>be ripe for destruction"</i> (Helaman 13:14). Samuel’s warning to the people of Zarahemla packs an extra punch by evoking the prophetic word against the doomed wicked of Ammonihah, who were utterly destroyed after they cast out and killed the righteous among them (Alma 16:9-11). <br><br>
Samuel reproved the Nephites for rejecting true prophets and accepting false ones. The wicked Nephites would support and reward false prophets who flattered them, excused iniquity, and said that "all is well" (Helaman 13:28). Apart from Samuel, only Nephi uses the phrase "all is well" when he writes against false prophets (2 Nephi 28:21, 25). By using Nephi’s words, Samuel suggests that the Nephites’ behavior would also be condemned by Nephi. <br><br>
When he prophesies about the future of the Lamanites, Samuel notes that, in contrast to the Nephites, Lamanite converts "do observe to keep his commandments and statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses" (Helaman 15:5). Nephi wrote that the first generation of Nephites "did observe to keep the judgments and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things according to the law of Moses" (2 Nephi 5:10). The words "observe," "statutes," "commandments," "judgments," and "law of Moses" are only used together by Nephi and Samuel. Samuel seemingly shows how the converted Lamanites of his day were righteous, like the early Nephites who, ironically, had fled from the Lamanites to be obedient to God. <br><br>
Samuel prophesies that in the future, the Lord will be merciful to the Lamanites, and tells the Nephites of Zarahemla, "It shall be better for them than for you except ye repent" (Helaman 15:14). Notably, this wording matches and supports the testimony of Nephi the son of Helaman who taught, "It shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent" (Helaman 7:23). Samuel not only cites Nephite prophets from the past, but also the current prophet of his day, whose name is Nephi, to call the people of that name to repentance. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Lamanite converts were taught the scriptures from the plates of brass and the plates of Nephi by Nephite missionaries (Alma 37:1-10). During the time of the judges, selections from these scriptures, likely written on less permanent materials, were more widely available (Alma 63:12). "It may be that Samuel had treasured up the prophetic word and thus was able to be inspired to use these and other passages as he spoke to the Nephites."<sup>2</sup>  Samuel’s words suggest that he knew his scriptures well. If we treasure up the words of the prophets, we may also be inspired in our time of need.
