  "description": "The Book of Mormon gives us little information about Samuel’s background, other than the fact that he was a Lamanite. He preached to the people of Nephi in the city of Zarahemla. His initial efforts to preach were rejected and he was cast out of the city. Undeterred by this, Samuel climbed upon the wall of the city so that his message would be heard. He described curses that would come upon the land, and warned the Nephites of their future destruction as a people, if they did not repent. He also prophesied of the birth and death of Christ and announced numerous signs that would coincide with these significant events. \n\n After he faithfully delivered his message, the people attempted to kill him, but he escaped. He was never seen again among the people of Nephi. His prophecies, which were all fulfilled, were remembered many years after they were given (3 Nephi 1:6, 19-21; 23:9-13; Mormon 1:19).",
