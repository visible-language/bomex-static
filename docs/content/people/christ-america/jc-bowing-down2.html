  <td>And now behold, I say unto you that the right way is to believe in Christ, and deny him not; and Christ is the Holy One of Israel; wherefore ye must <b><i>bow down before him</i></b>, and <b><i>worship him</i></b> with all your might, mind, and strength, and your whole soul; and if ye do this ye shall in nowise be cast out (2 Nephi 25:29).</td>	
  <td>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude <b><i>fell to the earth;</i></b> for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven (3 Nephi 11:12).
<br><br>
And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying: Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did <b><i>fall down</i></b> at the feet of Jesus, and did <b><i>worship</i></b> him (3 Nephi 11:16-17).
<br><br>
And Nephi arose and went forth, and <b><i>bowed himself before the Lord</i></b> and did kiss his feet (3 Nephi 11:19).</td>
