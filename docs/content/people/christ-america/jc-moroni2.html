<i>Moroni 10:23</i> <br><br>
In his final words to the reader of the Book of Mormon, Moroni draws upon words of Jesus known to him: <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And <b>Christ truly said unto our fathers: </b>If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me </i>(Moroni 10:23). </p><br><br>
This statement attributed to Jesus is similar to Mormon’s quotation in Moroni 7:33, but is not exactly the same. This suggests that it might have been from a different source, or perhaps the statements in Moroni 7:33 and 10:23 represent these prophets� paraphrasing of Jesus� words, rather than an exact record. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Moroni’s paraphrases of Jesus� words in the book of Ether point to additional teachings of the resurrected Savior that were part of the Nephite archive. They also suggest that at least one parable may have been part of the larger corpus of material from the resurrected Savior to his Saints in the New World. This increases our appreciation for Moroni’s additional inclusions of these precious teachings from the Savior. <br><br>
Moroni’s citation of a Mark-like passage provides an additional testimony to the Book of Mormon reader that Mark’s teachings are genuine, although biblical-manuscript evidence for similar teachings in Mark’s Gospel may be weak or potentially problematic.  <br><br>
Mormon, in his final testimony, wrote concerning the Book of Mormon and the Bible: "For behold, this is written for the intent that ye may believe that; and if ye believe that ye will believe this also" (Mormon 7:9). This constitutes a significant example of how the words of Jesus in the Book of Mormon confirm the words of Jesus found in the Bible, and how they both work together to increase our faith in the gospel of Jesus Christ.  <br><br>
