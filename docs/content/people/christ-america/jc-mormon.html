      Mormon, the chief abridger of the Nephite record known as the Book of Mormon, provides an account of the teachings of Jesus in 3 Nephi. He indicates that he included only a small part of the Savior’s teachings available to him (3 Nephi 26:8). Notably, both he and his son Moroni occasionally refer to or provide quotations from the resurrected Jesus to the Nephites that are not found in the selection in 3 Nephi. In this piece, we will look at examples from Mormon’s words, such as this one. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now it came to pass that when <b>Jesus had expounded all the scriptures in one, which they had written,</b> he commanded them that they should <b>teach the things which he had expounded unto them</b> <i>(3 Nephi 23:14).</p> <br><br>
In another passage, Mormon writes: <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now it came to pass that when Jesus had told these things <b>he expounded them unto the multitude;</b> and <b>he did expound all things unto them, both great and small. </b><br><br>
And he saith: These scriptures, which ye had not with you, the Father commanded that I should give unto you; for it was wisdom in him that they should be given unto future generations.  <br><br>
<b>And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his glory</b>---yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away; <br><br>
And even unto the great and last day, when all people, and all kindreds, and all nations and tongues shall stand before God, to be judged of their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil--- <br><br>
If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, who was before the world began </i>(3 Nephi 26:1-5).</p> <br><br>
Mormon mentions that Jesus provided a detailed exposition and teachings about these things, but does not quote or provide details about what Jesus actually said. He just gives a very general outline of the subject matter. He then explains, <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now <b>there cannot be written in this book even a hundredth part of the things which Jesus did truly teach unto the people;</b>  <br><br>
But behold the plates of Nephi do contain the more part of the things which he taught the people.  <br><br>
And <b>these things</b> have I written, which are <b>a lesser part of the things which he taught the people;</b> and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken. <br><br>
And when they shall have received <b>this,</b> which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them.  <br><br>
And if it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the <b>greater things</b> be withheld from them, unto their condemnation.  <br><br>
Behold, <b>I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it,</b> saying: I will try the faith of my people.  <br><br>
Therefore, <b>I, Mormon, do write the things which have been commanded me</b> of the Lord </i>(3 Nephi 26:6-12).</p> <br><br>
So, when Mormon was recording the words of Jesus in his abridgment of the Nephite records in 3 Nephi, he was commanded by the Lord to only include a small part of the available teachings of Jesus. When he discusses the future ministry of the three Nephite disciples, he does not go into detail, but mentions that there are other teachings of Jesus that discuss what they will do. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And behold they will be among the Gentiles, and the Gentiles shall know them not. <br><br>
They will also be among the Jews, and the Jews shall know them not.  <br><br>
And it shall come to pass, when the Lord seeth fit in his wisdom that they shall minister unto all the scattered tribes of Israel, and unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, and shall bring out of them unto Jesus many souls, that their desire may be fulfilled, and also because of the convincing power of God which is in them.  <br><br>
And they are as the angels of God, and if they shall pray unto the Father in the name of Jesus they can show themselves unto whatsoever man it seemeth them good. <br><br>
Therefore, great and marvelous works shall be wrought by them, before the great and coming day when all people must surely stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; <br><br>
Yea even among the Gentiles shall there be a great and marvelous work wrought by them, before that judgment day.  <br><br>
<b>And if ye had all the scriptures which give an account of all the marvelous works of Christ, ye would, according to the words of Christ, know that these things must surely come. </b></i> (3 Nephi 28:27-33).</p> <br><br>
Here, Mormon alludes to other words of Christ, which provide details on these things, but he obediently discusses them only in general terms.  <br><br>
<i>3 Nephi 29:7</i> <br><br>
In another passage, Mormon writes: <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>Yea, and wo unto him that shall say at that day, to get gain, that there can be no miracle wrought by Jesus Christ; for he that doeth this shall become like unto the son of perdition, for whom there was no mercy, <b>according to the word of Christ! </b></i>(3 Nephi 29:7).</p> <br><br>
We do not have the words of Christ that speak about the son of perdition receiving no mercy, but apparently the Nephites had a record of them. Mormon mentions them, but does not quote them.
