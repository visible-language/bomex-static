<i>Mormon 9:22-25</i> <br><br>
Moroni, who took charge of the Nephite record after the death of his father, quotes additional words from the resurrected Jesus’ teachings to the Nephites in his own writings. The longest example is as follows. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>For behold, <b>thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the multitude:<b> Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;  <br><br> 
And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned; <br><br>
And these signs shall follow them that believe—in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover;  <br><br>
And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth </i>(Mormon 9:22-25).</p> <br><br>
This passage partially resembles words found in Mark 16:15-18, a passage that some biblical scholars have argued was not original to the text of Mark. What is interesting here is that Moroni solemnly affirms that Jesus spoke these words to the three Nephite disciples and the Nephite Twelve, and the multitude heard it also. Numerous witnesses could testify that Jesus gave these words to the Nephites.  <br><br>
This is an example in which the Book of Mormon supports the teachings of Jesus we have received through the Bible. It suggests that, whatever the textual history of Mark, these were authentic words of the Savior that somehow were either lost from earlier biblical manuscripts or were given orally by the Savior and not recorded, but which are true.<sup>1</sup>  <br><br>
Moroni also draws upon teachings of the resurrected Jesus in his abridgment of the book of Ether. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people.  <br><br>
<b>And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he commanded that they should be made manifest </b></i>(Ether 4:1-2). </p><br><br>
We do not have the account Moroni speaks of in 3 Nephi, but it was included in Jesus’ teachings to the Nephites that Moroni knows about. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And <b>I also remember that thou hast said</b> that thou hast <b>prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father,</b> in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared </i>(Ether 12:32).</p> <br><br>
This passage is interesting because it reminds us of John 14:2, although it reads differently and includes additional teachings. This suggests that Moroni is citing a passage from teachings not included by Mormon in 3 Nephi, but which may have been similar to those taught by Jesus to the Apostles.  <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not charity, because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and <b>take away their talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly</b> </i>(Ether 12:35). </p><br><br>
This passage again reminds us of similar teachings from Jesus in the New Testament, in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30). This suggests that the Nephites may have possessed a similar parable (or its equivalent in Nephite terms, since "talent" was a word peculiar to the Roman World), which Moroni drew upon in his commentary and applied to the Gentiles. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And again, <b>I remember that thou hast said</b> that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men </i>(Ether 12:33). </p><br><br>
While this concept is found in other Book of Mormon passages, the difference in phrasing indicates that Moroni drew upon additional words of Jesus.
