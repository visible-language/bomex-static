  "description": "For the people of Nephi in the land of promise, the Savior’s manifestation to them, after His death and His appearance in glory following His resurrection from the dead, was a transformative event. At the beginning of the thirty-fourth year after the sign of Jesus’ birth had been given, there was great destruction among the wicked, followed by three days of darkness. It was during this time of darkness that Jesus Christ announced the scope of the destruction that had occurred, identified Himself as the Creator and Redeemer, and invited those who had not been destroyed to repent and receive Him (3 Nephi 9:1-22; 10:3-7). \n\nLater, at the end of that same year, while the people were gathered at a temple in the land of Bountiful, Jesus descended from heaven and taught the people for a period of three days (3 Nephi 11-26). He continued to visit them from time to time thereafter during this time of righteousness (3 Nephi 26-28). Many of the words He spoke to the people during this visitation were recorded, including those that Mormon was permitted to inscribe in the Book of Mormon (3 Nephi 26:6-11).",
