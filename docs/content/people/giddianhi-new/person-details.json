  "description": "Giddianhi was a leader of the Gadianton robbers. Under his leadership, the robbers waged a bloody and deadly war against the people of Nephi (3 Nephi 2:11). Giddianhi sent a letter to the Nephite chief judge, Lachoneus I, insisting that he and the Nephites surrender their rights and territory to the robbers (3 Nephi 3:1-10). Lachoneus refused and the Nephites defended themselves (3 Nephi 4:13-26). Giddianhi’s people were unable to plunder the Nephites’ resources and were forced to battle against them (3 Nephi 4:2-4). The Nephites defeated them and killed Giddianhi (3 Nephi 4:14).",
