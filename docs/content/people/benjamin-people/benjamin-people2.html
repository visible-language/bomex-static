The words of Benjamin’s people, brief as they are, respond to some of the teachings of their king. Benjamin spoke of "<b><i>a never-ending torment"</i></b> (Mosiah 2:39). His people also speak of "<b><i>a never-ending torment,"</i></b> a curse that they earnestly hope to avoid (Mosiah 5:5). <br><br>
Benjamin said that they had come to "<b><i>a knowledge</i></b> of <b><i>the goodness of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:5-6), and also "<b><i>a knowledge</i></b> of the glory of God," which brought them "exceedingly <b><i>great joy"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:11). Benjamin’s people speak of "the infinite <b><i>goodness of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:3), and of having received "great <b><i>knowledge,"</i></b> which brought them "<b><i>great joy"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:4). <br><br>
Benjamin’s people were deeply influenced by the words of the angel and their king. The following phrases are only used by King Benjamin’s people: "apply the atoning blood of Christ," "forgiveness of our sins," "hearts may be purified," "infinite goodness of God," "manifestations of his Spirit," "no more disposition to do evil," "not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God," "the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent," "willing to enter into a covenant," and "wrought a mighty change in us." <br><br>
If, as some have suggested, this speech was given during an Israelite festival, it is possible that the response given by the people was a prepared one, based upon the words and teachings given in the address.<sup>1</sup>  Benjamin clearly hoped that his words would be received positively and was well prepared. Still, the impact of his words upon the people may have been unexpected.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Not everyone responds positively to the message of prophets, even when that message comes from an angel (1 Nephi 3:31; Helaman 13:7, 9; 16:2). Sometimes, however, the power of the Holy Ghost surprises us. The response of Benjamin’s people is remarkable because it shows how a mighty change, one that transforms hearts from evil to good, can occur when a people hearkens to the prophets and acts in humble sincerity and faith. If we hearken to the prophets in our day and act in faith, we can also receive this mighty change of heart.
