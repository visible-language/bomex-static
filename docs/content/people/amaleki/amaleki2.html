Nephi mentioned his genealogy, but said he recorded it on his other plates (1 Nephi 6:1). Amaleki mentions the genealogy of Zarahemla and states that it was written, "but not on these plates" (Omni 1:18). Nephi mentioned "wars and contentions" with the Lamanites (2 Nephi 5:34). Amaleki mentions a "war and serious contentions" among the people of Zarahemla before Mosiah’s arrival (Omni 1:17). Amaleki’s teaching that we should worship God "with [our] whole souls" (Omni 1:26) echoes Nephi’s teachings to worship with "your whole soul" (2 Nephi 25:29). Nephi taught that "Christ is the Holy One of Israel" (2 Nephi 25:29). Amaleki wrote of "Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel" (Omni 1:26).<br><br>
Amaleki seems to have influenced subsequent Nephite writers, such as Alma, Mormon, and Moroni. The teaching, "there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord: and that which is evil comes from the devil" (Omni 1:25), seems to have been known and taught by Alma and Mormon. Alma taught, "For I say unto you that whatsoever is good cometh from God, and whatsoever is evil cometh from the devil" (Alma 5:40). According to Mormon, "all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil" (Moroni 7:12).<br><br>
Both Amaleki and Moroni had the unique task of completing a set of plates. Both writers invite the reader to "come unto Christ," a phrase only used four times in the Book of Mormon (Omni 1:26; Jacob 1:7; Moroni 10:30, 32). Both mention the importance of spiritual gifts (Omni 1:25; Moroni 10:8-18).<sup>1</sup> <br><br>
Amaleki’s teaching that we should come unto God "and offer our whole souls as an offering unto him" (Omni 1:26), is interesting in light of sacrificial practices under the law of Moses. In contrast to other sacrifices, the burnt offering was one in which the entire animal was offered and sacrificed upon the altar. The Nephites kept the law of Moses, and Amaleki seems to draw upon the burnt-offering idea to express how to properly and sincerely worship God.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Amaleki’s words and teachings, even though they are brief, suggest he was a man who was anxious for others to accept and follow the inspired leadership of the prophet. He valued the spiritual gifts that he saw manifested in the life of his king, and faithfully fulfilled his responsibilities as a record keeper and teacher. We also can follow our prophet’s leadership, seek out spiritual gifts, and faithfully fulfill our responsibilities.
<br><br><br><br>
<sup>1</sup>  Moroni’s wording resembles that of Paul in the New Testament (1 Corinthians 12:4-11). This might suggest that both Paul and Moroni were drawing upon teachings of Jesus that we do not have at present (John 21:25; 3 Nephi 26:6-7).
