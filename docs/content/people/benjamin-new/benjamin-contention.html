King Benjamin’s sermon was given at one of the high points of Nephite history (Mosiah 1:11). It is easy to forget that this came after an earlier period of serious difficulty and social conflict. Both Amaleki and Mormon mention that Benjamin witnessed serious contentions and dissensions among his people, early in his reign, and it was only through prolonged and diligent effort that he and other prophets had been able to establish the peace we find at the time of his farewell address (Omni 1:24-25, 27-28; Words of Mormon 1:12-18).  <br><br>
Benjamin solemnly warned his people about future contention and emphasized that such difficulties are inspired and fomented by "the evil spirit" or the devil (Mosiah 2:32-33; 4:14). No doubt based upon experiences from earlier in his reign, Benjamin taught by word and example how humility and gratitude for God’s blessings, which none of us deserve, keep us humble. Continual prayer and service to others also increase our happiness and joy (Mosiah 4:11-12).  <br><br>
Happy parents will not allow their children to engage in contention, but will actively create opportunities for them to serve each other, which will foster love and understanding among family members (Mosiah 4:14-15). This will help them to develop a love of truth and look for opportunities to serve (Mosiah 4:15-16). Benjamin’s act of bestowing upon his people a new name as children of Christ (Mosiah 5:7-12) reinforced this egalitarian teaching, helping people of different cultures and backgrounds (the people of Zarahemla and the Nephites, like people today), to see each other as one people before God. <br><br>
Mormon indicates that the problem of "false Christs," "false prophets, and false preachers and teachers" (Words of Mormon 1:15-16) was associated with the contention and dissensions earlier in Benjamin’s reign. If these false teachers were among those who were seeking to replace Benjamin as the rightful king, then his focus upon Christ as the heavenly king in his final sermon can be seen as a way to correct the erroneous ideas that had contributed to the conflicts of the past. For Benjamin, a proper king, leader, or teacher is one who is unselfish, who does not seek for riches or worldly power, but who unselfishly seeks to uplift and strengthen others and acknowledges, obeys, relies upon, and emulates God, our heavenly king.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s words and example fostered happiness and peace among his people. When we read his teachings, we should seek to understand how those teachings can help us to establish greater happiness in our families and communities today. Benjamin’s words and teachings can help us avoid the traps of false examples of leadership and emulate the pattern set by Jesus Christ.
