A significant focus of King Benjamin’s teachings is our treatment of the poor. He is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the words "beggar," "beggars," "begged," "supporting," and "dependent." He also is the only one to use the words "borroweth," "lending," and "indebted." It is the poor and needy who most often must borrow from others. This concern for the less fortunate among his people sets Benjamin apart from other leaders who sought for power and gain. <br><br>
Benjamin, however, places the rich and the poor on equal footing by noting that <b><i>all,</i></b> even kings, are beggars indebted to God, an idea that would have seemed surprising to many of the people of his day. Benjamin emphasized that we are all indebted to God, a debt that we are never able to repay (Mosiah 2:21-26). Yet, all that God requires of us is to lend Him our obedience, walk in humility, pray daily, and give according to our means (Mosiah 2:22; 4:11, 24-27).  <br><br>
Benjamin also corrects the erroneous view that one should only help those who deserve it, noting that before God, all are unprofitable servants who receive divine mercy and blessings (Mosiah 4:17-23). This realization and daily remembrance of our lowly and unprofitable state before God schools us in how to approach Him with humble reverence and respect. It helps us to avoid the toxic dangers of pride and selfishness. Benjamin not only speaks of our responsibility to minister to the poor, but also emphasizes the blessings that such service brings to our lives, such as retaining a remission of our sins from day to day (Mosiah 4:12).  <br><br>
As we remember our own unworthiness before God, and remember and seek to bring physical and spiritual relief to those in need (Mosiah 4:11-12), we will "always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God" (Mosiah 4:12), "grow in the knowledge and glory" of God (Mosiah 4:12), and have no desire to injure others (Mosiah 4:13). Only those who serve God as their Master can really know Him (Mosiah 5:13). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>King Benjamin’s words and teachings show how ministering to others increases our happiness and our knowledge of the God who loves us, and helps us to become sanctified. As a righteous and humble king, he pointed his people to Christ. When we read Benjamin’s words, we should try to become more aware of the needs of others and find ways to minister according to our means and ability.
