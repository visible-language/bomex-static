His words are taken from private teachings to his sons (Mosiah 1:3-7), his son Mosiah II (Mosiah 1:10-14), and his final sermon to his people several years before his death, in which he introduces his son Mosiah II as the new king (Mosiah 2:9-41; 3:1-2; 4:4-30; 5:6-15). Shortly before his sermon, Benjamin was visited by an angel who testified of Christ, and the king included the angel’s message in his words to his people (Mosiah 3:2-27). These words had a remarkable effect upon the people of his day, which was remembered many years later (Helaman 5:9). <br><br>
Apart from the angel (Mosiah 3:5, 17-18, 21), Benjamin is the only Book of Mormon prophet who uses the word "omnipotent" as an attribute of God (Mosiah 5:2, 15). It makes sense that, as a king who was becoming acutely aware of his frailty in his aging years, he would choose to emphasize the incomparable power of God. <br><br>
Other words used exclusively by Benjamin include "render" (3), "attention" (1), "adulterous" (1), "attempting" (1), "injure" (1), "interest" (1), "list" (1), "lively" (1), "peaceably" (1), "prize" (1), "proclaim" (1), "pronounced" (1), "quarrel" (1), "require" (1), "requires" (1), "secondly" (1), "stopped" (1), "trifle" (1), "who ever" (1), and "worthless" (1). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>After rehearsing the words of the angel of God, who taught of the atoning work of the Lord Omnipotent, Benjamin uses the same term for God that had been used by the messenger. The term omnipotent denotes God’s power to do all things according to His will, including His power to bless His children according to their faith and obedience. As we read the words of King Benjamin, we should think of ways to exercise greater faith, so that the Lord may more fully bless us.
