Ammon's words appear to be influenced by Alma's description of his conversion. Alma said, "I was <b><i>in the darkest abyss</i></b>; but now I <b><i>behold the marvelous light of God</i></b>" (Mosiah 27:29). Ammon says, "Our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even <b><i>in the darkest abyss</i></b>, but behold, how many of them are brought to <b><i>behold the marvelous light of God!</i></b>" (Alma 26:3). <br><br>
Ammon is the only Nephite prophet, besides Alma, to use the word "snatch." Alma marveled, "The Lord in mercy hath seen fit to <b><i>snatch</i></b> me out of an everlasting burning" (Mosiah 27:28), and "my soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am <b><i>snatched,</i></b> and my soul is pained no more" (Mosiah 27:29). Ammon asks his brethren, "Who could have supposed that our God would have been so merciful as to have <b><i>snatched</i></b> us from our awful, sinful, and polluted state?" (Alma 26:17). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Ammon's words reflect the love and empathy he has for those he teaches. They also paint a picture of a man who recognizes God's miraculous mercy in his life, his brethren's, and his Lamanite converts'. His language conveys the impression that when he witnessed their conversion, he could not help but think of his own. When we read Ammon's words, we also can recognize how merciful God can be to those who repent and place their trust in Him.
