Korihor is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the words "whims," "derangement," "frenzied," "foolish," "foolish traditions," "ordinances and performances," "unknown being," and "pretended mysteries." His application of the word "pretended" to Nephite spiritual gifts is noteworthy. His words reinforce his false materialistic message, which asserts that one can only know what one can experience with the natural senses. <br><br> 
In Korihor’s view, God is an "unknown being" because people cannot see him. Nephite mysteries are "pretended" for the same reason. Korihor’s words reveal the tactics of the devil, who taught him what to say. His words are crafted to make those who believe and obey Gospel ordinances appear foolish. He uses the unique phrase, "the foolish traditions of your fathers," three times. <br><br>
Korihor deceived his listeners by appealing to their carnal nature and by making obedience to divine commandments seem difficult. He turned Nephite teachings about redemption from the bondage of sin and the liberty of the Gospel on their heads by characterizing the belief in Christ, and the need to prepare for life after this, as a form of bondage that kept individuals from doing what they wanted. His teachings appeal to the natural man.  <br><br>
Freedom, according to Korihor, was living without constraints. "Ye say that this people is a free people. Behold, I say they are in bondage" (Alma 30:24). He characterized those who followed the teachings of Christ using the terms "bound down," they "bind themselves down," are "brought down," under a "yoke," and are in "bondage." He asserted that Nephite religious leaders wanted to "keep them down" in a state of subservience. He claimed that religious leaders wanted to "glut" themselves on the labors and fruits of others, based on things that could not be seen or experienced by those they exploited.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Korihor’s clever, but empty, words were inspired by the devil. His messages were designed to flatter the unwary and lead people lead away from Christ. His words in the Book of Mormon can help us to detect similar falsehoods and deceptions today.
