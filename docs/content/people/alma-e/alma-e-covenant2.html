When we compare Alma’s words about the baptismal covenant with the words of the Lord to Alma’s people when they were in bondage, we can see that the Lord did what His people had earlier promised Him that they would do. As they had covenanted to comfort others and bear their burdens that they might be light, so the Lord comforted and bore the weight of His people’s burdens and afflictions that they were made light---to the point that they could not feel them upon their backs! As they covenanted to be witnesses of God at all times and places, the Lord blessed them with deliverance that they could continue to testify of His miraculous mercy and intervention in the future. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>The words of Alma and the Lord about covenants teach us what it means to be called the Lord’s people. When we read what the Book of Mormon teaches about covenants, we should pay attention to how those covenant blessings are honored and fulfilled. As a covenant people, we can know that the Lord will bless us, just as we have promised Him to serve and bless others. He often honors those covenants in ways we may not anticipate, sometimes with blessings beyond measure.
