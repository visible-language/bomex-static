When Lehi blessed his son Jacob before his death, he noted that, notwithstanding his afflictions, his son knew of "the greatness of God" (2 Nephi 2:2). Jacob’s knowledge of God’s greatness is indeed reflected in his sermons to the people of Nephi. Jacob speaks of God’s "greatness" (2 Nephi 9:53). Three times, he speaks of "the great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:5-6; Jacob 3:7). He also speaks of "the greatness of the Holy One of Israel" (2 Nephi 9:40). <br><br>
In addition to his characterization of the Lord as great, Jacob draws attention to, and even marvels at, the many attributes of God that make Him great. He speaks of the great "<b><i>goodness</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:10), the great "<b><i>holiness</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:20), "the greatness of the <b><i>mercy</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:19, 53), his "great <b><i>mercy"</i></b> (Jacob 4:10), "the greatness and the <b><i>justice</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:17), "his greatness and his <b><i>grace"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:53), his "great <b><i>condescensions</i></b> unto the children of men" (Jacob 4:7; 2 Nephi 9:53), and the "great and marvelous . . . <b><i>works</i></b> of the Lord" (Jacob 4:8). Significantly, he also speaks of the "great <b><i>plan of our God"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:13), His "great <b><i>plan of redemption"</i></b> (Jacob 6:8), and rejoices in His great "<b><i>covenants"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:53) and great "<b><i>promises,"</i></b> which He makes available to His children (2 Nephi 10:9, 21). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>While other Book of Mormon speakers and writers use the words "great" and "greatness," Jacob applies these words to God and His characteristics with greater variety and frequency than any other Book of Mormon prophet. This is a significant theme that runs through Jacob’s teachings and is a distinct characteristic of his words, setting him apart from other Book of Mormon speakers. Readers of Jacob’s words should ponder how it was that Jacob came to understand God’s greatness, in spite of his many afflictions and challenges, and perhaps strive to do likewise.
