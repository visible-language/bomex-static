Note, the Garden of Eden was holy because God dwelt there with man, just as God will eventually dwell with Zion. God’s people will be made holy like the garden was holy.</td> 	  <td><i>O how great the <b>holiness</b> of our God! </i>(2 Nephi 9:20). <br><br><i>

Jacob also discussed the "<b>holy</b> prophets" (2 Nephi 9:2), the "<b>Holy</b> One of Israel" (2 Nephi 9:11-12, 18-19, 23-26, 39, 41, 51), the Lord’s great <b>"holiness"</b> (2 Nephi 9:20), his <b>"holy</b> judgment" (2 Nephi 9:15, 46), his <b>"holy</b> name" (2 Nephi 9:52), and the "saints of the <b>Holy</b> One" (2 Nephi 9:18). </td>
