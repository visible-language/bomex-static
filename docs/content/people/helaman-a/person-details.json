  "description": "Helaman was one of the sons of Alma II and became high priest over the Church, following the departure of his father. During the long war with the Lamanites, Helaman led a force of 2000 sons of the Ammonite converts. Their military actions were a key factor in the victory of the Nephite forces in the southern quarter of the land and the recapture of Nephite possessions in that sector. Helaman’s words come primarily from a lengthy letter he wrote to Captain Moroni, who was the chief commander over the Nephite forces during the war.",
