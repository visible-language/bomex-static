In his letter to Moroni, the prophet Helaman, the son of Alma, uses phrases from God’s counsel to Joshua to recount how he and his army of stripling warriors overcame their challenges in the war with the Lamanites. The confidence of the young striplings that "<b><i>God is with us</i></b>" (Alma 56:46) recalls the Lord’s promise to Joshua that, "as I was with Moses, <b><i>so I will be with thee:</i></b> I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Joshua 1:5), and "the Lord thy <b><i>God is with thee</i></b>" (Joshua 1:9). <br><br>
The Lord counseled Joshua to "be <b><i>strong</i></b> and of a good <b><i>courage</i></b>" (Joshua 1:6, 9), and "be thou <b><i>strong</i></b> and <b><i>very courageous</i></b>" (Joshua 1:7). Helaman stresses the courage of his little army. "Never had I seen so <b><i>great courage,</i></b> nay, not among all the Nephites" (Alma 56:45; 58:12). Helaman notes that he and his Ammonite force "were <b><i>not strong</i></b>, according to our numbers" (Alma 58:15), yet they were strong in the faith of God and their obedience to His commandments. "Their faith is <b><i>strong</i></b> in the prophecies concerning that which is to come" (Alma 58:40). <br><br>
Recognizing their numerical weakness, they looked to God for strength. "Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would <b><i>strengthen</i></b> us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us <b><i>strength</i></b>" (Alma 58:10). Such strength was given them that they frightened their enemies, even though they were fewer in numbers.  "They had fought as if with the <b><i>strength of God;</i></b> yea, never were men known to have fought with such <b><i>miraculous strength;</i></b> and with such mighty power" (Alma 56:56).<br><br>
Helaman states that when their enemies pursued them, they "durst <b><i>not turn to the right nor to the left</i></b> lest they should be surrounded; neither would I <b><i>turn to the right nor to the left</i></b> lest they should overtake me" (Alma 56:40). This phrase echoes the Lord’s counsel to Joshua that he "<b><i>observe</i></b> to do" God’s law and "<b><i>turn not from it to the right hand or to the left</i></b>" (Joshua 1:7). The decisive efforts of Helaman’s forces led to a Nephite victory. <br><br>
Helaman says that his young army "did obey and <b><i>observe</i></b> to perform every word of command with exactness" (Alma 57:21). This military discipline was equaled by their moral rectitude: They never deviated from their obligations to God. Helaman says, "they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do <b><i>observe</i></b> to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually" (Alma 58:40).<br><br>
The words "right" and "left" are used together by several other Book of Mormon speakers in reference to those on the right or left hand of God at the day of judgment (Mosiah 5:10, 12), to God’s ways (Alma 7:20; 3 Nephi 29:9), and to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were willing to stand unmovable, even in the face of death (Alma 24:23). Only Helaman uses it in connection with the movement of armies.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>By employing the language of the Lord to his Josephite ancestor Joshua, the prophet Helaman underscored how he and his young warriors were faithful and obedient to the Lord’s commandments, and were thereby blessed with success during a difficult and challenging time. When we read Helaman’s letter to Moroni, we should ponder how we can find greater blessings in our own difficulties, by increasing our faith and obedience to the words of the Lord.
