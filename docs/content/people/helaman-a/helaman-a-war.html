Helaman’s words suggest that he was familiar with military texts, such as the book of Joshua on the plates of brass, and alluded to them to teach the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God. Helaman’s father Alma had entrusted him with the plates of brass and reminded him of their value (Alma 37:3-20). Evidence suggests that Helaman took this counsel to heart and studied earlier military accounts, such as the book of Joshua, a version of which was presumably included in those records. <br><br>
The tactics used to recapture the city of Manti are similar to those used by the Israelites in their successful campaign against the Canaanite fortress of Ai. <br><br>
<ol>
  <li>There is an assurance of victory (Joshua 8:1; Alma 58:10-11), </li>
  <li>A small force pitches their tents outside the city (Joshua 8:10-11; Alma 58:13),</li> 
  <li>An ambush is set (Joshua 8:4, 12-13; Alma 58:18), </li>
  <li>The enemy army is decoyed out of their fortifications by the smaller army (Joshua 8:14-15; Alma 58:19), and</li>
  <li>The hidden ambush party captures the city (Joshua 8:17, 19; Alma 58:20-22). </li>
</ol>
These similarities are particularly interesting because the Israelite victory over Ai followed on the heels of a disastrous defeat, due to Israel’s transgression. Israel was unable to proceed with their campaign until the transgression was dealt with (Joshua 7). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Helaman’s account of the eventual victory of his army underscores the miraculous blessings that are available when the Lord’s people, like Helaman’s young warriors, are universally faithful. This faithfulness helped them to maintain their liberty and protect their people against their enemies. <br><br>
When we read Helaman’s account, we should ponder how a knowledge of the scriptures can help us to be successful in our daily struggles and remain faithful, even when surrounded by wickedness and those who promote it. A knowledge of the scriptures and their worth helps us to live righteous lives and pursue lasting happiness.
