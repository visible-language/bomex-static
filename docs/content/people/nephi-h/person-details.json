  "description": "Nephi was the son of Helaman II and the great-grandson of the prophet Alma II. He became the chief judge over the people of Nephi following the death of his father (Helaman 3:37). During his reign, there was a serious war with the Lamanites, in which the Nephites lost the land of Zarahemla and most of their possessions in the land southward (Helaman 4:5-10). They had, at this time, fallen into a state of serious apostasy (Helaman 4:11-26). Like his great-grandfather Alma, Nephi yielded up his office as chief judge and devoted the remainder of his life to the ministry (Helaman 5:1-3).",
