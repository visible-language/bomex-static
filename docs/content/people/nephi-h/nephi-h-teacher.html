      Nephi’s use of vivid words and images to describe impending destruction is notable, such as when he says that the devil "is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo" (Helaman 7:16). The image is that of being violently thrown over a cliff. In another example, he addresses the wicked Nephites, who are seeking gain through wickedness, by reversing the image of piling up riches into building a mound of self-destructive corruption that will be visible evidence of their abominations. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>Even at this time, instead of <b>laying up</b> for yourselves <b>treasures</b> in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are <b>heaping up</b> for yourselves <b>wrath</b> against the day of judgment </i> (Helaman 8:25).  </p><br>
Nephi also shows the ability to make object lessons out of the actions of his listeners. As the people gather around him as he prays on the tower in his garden, he asks, "Why have ye <b><i>gathered</i></b> yourselves together?" (Helaman 7:13), and observes, "Because of my mourning and lamentation ye have <b><i>gathered</i></b> yourselves together" (Helaman 7:15). He then announces that, "instead of <b><i>gathering you</i></b>," the Good Shepherd "shall <b><i>scatter</i></b> you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts" (Helaman 7:19). <br><br>
As he defends himself from the accusation of being a false prophet, Nephi shows his familiarity with the Nephites’ scriptural heritage by appealing to no fewer than nine prophets by name, and many other unnamed ones who testified of Christ, in just seven verses. He specifically names Moses, Abraham, Zenos, Zenock, Ezias, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lehi, and Nephi, but also appeals to "many" others before and after the time of Abraham (Helaman 8:16-22). This shows his familiarity with and confidence in citing the scriptures. <br><br>
The name "Zarahemla" appears to be a Hebrew name that means "seed" (zera) of "compassion" (hemla). In its verbal form, hemla can also mean "to spare" or "to have mercy." It was the name of a descendant of Mulek, the only surviving son or seed of king Zedekiah of Judah, who was spared when all the others were killed. When he speaks to the people of Zarahemla, Nephi seems to make a wordplay when he tells the wicked of <b><i>Zarahemla</i></b> that, while they will be destroyed if they fail to repent, "the Lord will be <b><i>merciful</i></b> unto [the Lamanites]; yea, he will lengthen out <b><i>their</i></b> days and increase <b><i>their seed,</i></b> even when <b><i>thou</i></b> shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent" (Helaman 7:24).<sup>1</sup>  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Nephi’s words show him to be a remarkable teacher who could effectively use creative images. His words conveyed rhetorical power by making use of objects, ideas, and actions familiar to his hearers, and linking them to a message of repentance that they could not easily ignore. As we have opportunities to teach, we can learn from the example of Nephi, and of our Savior, who spoke in parables. <br><br> <br><br>
