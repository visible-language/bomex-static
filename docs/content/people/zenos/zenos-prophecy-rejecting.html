The Lord manifested many signs and wonders before the people when He delivered the children of Israel from Egypt and led them through the wilderness. The Lord told Moses, "I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt" (Exodus 7:3). We are also told that "Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart" (Exodus 11:10; see also Deuteronomy 4:34; 6:22; 7:19; 26:8). In spite of these things and the many miracles He performed, the Israelites frequently murmured and rebelled against God. When they built a golden calf, the Lord told Moses, "they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them" (Exodus 32:8). On another occasion, God told them that because of their many sins, "your children shall wander in the wilderness" (Numbers 14:33). <br><br>
Zenos uses phrases from these earlier stories to tell how, during His mortal ministry at Jerusalem, the Lord’s people would "turn their hearts aside," like Pharaoh "rejecting signs and wonders and the power and glory of the God of Israel" (1 Nephi 19:13-14). As a result of this, many "shall wander in the flesh and perish" (1 Nephi 19:14). This connection with the wilderness apostasy is strengthened by the fact that Zenos refers to "turning aside" three times in this prophecy (1 Nephi 19:13-15). By drawing upon the language of the Exodus and wilderness accounts, Zenos frames the rejection of Israel’s Redeemer during His mortal ministry, as repeating the lamentable pattern of the past. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The prophecy of Israel’s rejection of the Son of God shows that Israel would reject and turn aside from their Redeemer, just as their ancestors had done in the wilderness. As we read the words of Zenos, we should ponder how we can prevent our hearts from turning aside, and keep them fixed on the words of our Redeemer, who is gathering Israel again in our day.
