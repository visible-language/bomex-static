The words of Zenos’ prophecy cited by Nephi (1 Nephi 19:11) evoke the events of the Israelite Exodus from Egypt and their wilderness journey. Zenos prophesied that "the Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, <b><i>some</i></b> with his voice because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation," while "others" would be visited by destructive forces of nature (1 Nephi 19:11). This prophecy of two kinds of visitation has roots in the Exodus story and the subsequent account of events in the wilderness. <br><br>
Before his death in the land of Egypt, Joseph the son of Jacob, who was Zenos’ patriarchal and tribal ancestor, told his brothers, "God will <b><i>surely visit you"</i></b> (Genesis 50:24-25). As a descendant of Joseph, Zenos would have been familiar with Joseph’s words. Many years later, when the Lord called Moses to lead Israel out of Egyptian bondage, He said, "I have <b><i>surely visited you"</i></b> (Exodus 3:16). When Moses conveyed these words to the elders, "the people believed: and when they heard that the Lord had <b><i>visited</i></b> the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped" (Exodus 4:31). When the Israelites camped at Mount Sinai, the Lord came down in glory on the mount. Then, "Moses spake, and God answered him by a <b><i>voice"</i></b> (Exodus 19:19). Moses was righteous and was then permitted to go up into the Lord’s presence, while the other children of Israel were not and were afraid (Exodus 19:16, 21). <br><br>
When the Israelites rebelled and built a golden calf, the Lord also told Moses, "whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: . . . Nevertheless in the day when I <b><i>visit</i></b> I will <b><i>visit</i></b> their sin upon them" (Exodus 32:33-34). This was fulfilled at various times in their desert journey when the people rebelled. Zenos, in his prophecy, draws upon words from these stories to show how, at a time of future rebellion and apostasy, the Lord would visit His people again at the time of His death, both the righteous and the wicked. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>It makes sense that Zenos, a prophet of the lineage of Joseph, would use the language of his tribal ancestor, as well as words and themes from the Exodus deliverance account, in a prophecy of the Savior’s deliverance of His people from the bondage of sin and rebellion. As we read the words of Zenos, we should try to observe how the Lord is blessing us today, in ways that continue to fulfill His promises to the house of Israel.
