Making the golden calf was a grievous transgression, for which the Lord could have utterly destroyed the children of Israel. At that time, Moses pled with the Lord to be merciful and "<b><i>remember</i></b> Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou <b><i>swarest</i></b> by thine own self" (Exodus 32:13). This plea that the Lord might be merciful and remember His ancient covenants is echoed in the prophecy of Zenos. <br><br>
After he describes how Israel would turn their hearts aside, reject the Son of God, and be scattered, Zenos states, "Nevertheless, when the day cometh that they no more turn aside their hearts against the Holy One of Israel, then will he <b><i>remember</i></b> the <b><i>covenants</i></b> which he made to their fathers" (1 Nephi 19:15). Zenos’ words neatly tie the covenant the Lord made with Abraham, Isaac, and Israel---which Moses pleaded to God to remember, even when Israel had sinned a grievous sin---with the promise that in the latter days, God would indeed remember the covenant with the fathers. This shows that, although they had once rejected Him, the Lord would not forget His people, but would eventually gather them in mercy. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Zenos’s teaching that the Lord would remember the ancient covenant made with the fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reminds us of how merciful the Lord has been and will be, if we will no longer turn aside our hearts from His words. He is our Redeemer and, in spite of our sins, is anxious to receive us when we are willing. Wherever we are, if we turn to God, He will welcome us with love and forgiveness.
