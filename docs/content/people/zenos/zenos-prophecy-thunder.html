Zenos prophesied that the Lord would visit the some of the house of Israel with "<b><i>thunderings</i></b> and the <b><i>lightnings</i></b> of his power, by tempest, by <b><i>fire,</i></b> and by <b><i>smoke"</i></b> (1 Nephi 19:11). These point back to the events at Mount Sinai, where the mount quaked and "there were <b><i>thunders</i></b> and <b><i>lightnings,</i></b> and a thick cloud upon the mount" (Exodus 19:16). This occurred when the Lord appeared upon the mount in glory and power. "And mount Sinai was altogether on a <b><i>smoke,</i></b> because the Lord descended upon it in <b><i>fire:</i></b> and the <b><i>smoke</i></b> thereof ascended as the <b><i>smoke</i></b> of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly" (Exodus 19:18). At this time, the children of Israel were very afraid and unprepared for this experience (Exodus 19:16). Zenos draws upon the wording of the Sinai event in his prophecy to teach how, at the time of the Lord’s atoning deliverance, as at that earlier event in the wilderness, many would be unprepared for His visit to His people. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Zenos clearly draws upon the wording of the events at Sinai to teach about the Lord’s visitation at the time of His death. His prophecy was a warning to the house of Israel to prepare for the promised joyful visitation of the Lord to His people, in the day of atoning deliverance. As we read this prophecy, we should look forward to the future return of the Lord and ponder how we can prepare for that day, so that it will be a day of great joy and salvation, not one of sorrow.
