Zenos’ prophecy cited by Nephi (1 Nephi 19:10-17) uses words from accounts of the Israelite Exodus from Egypt and their wilderness journey. He applies them, however, to the signs of the Lord’s death, His rejection by the house of Israel, and their latter-day redemption. His words suggest that he viewed these things as a continuation of the miraculous events witnessed by the Exodus generation, in fulfillment of the covenants God made with their fathers. This is shown in subsequent examples, which include <i>Visiting the House of Israel, Thunder and Lightning, Fire and Smoke, Mountains Carried Up, Opening of the Earth, Three Days of Darkness, Rejecting the Holy One of Israel,</i> and <i>Remembering the Covenant.</i> <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>These examples help us to understand that the Lord’s work is not done and that He remembers His promises. They also show that the story of the house of Israel is not complete, but continues, and that we each are part of that story. We can look to our Redeemer today, with hope and an expectation of great joy, as we prepare for His return.
