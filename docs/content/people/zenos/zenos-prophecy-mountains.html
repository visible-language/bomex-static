Zenos prophesied that one of the signs given to the house of Israel of the Lord’s death would be "mountains which shall be carried up" (1 Nephi 19:11). The Exodus story tells how Mount Sinai was considered holy because it was the place where the Lord Himself came down in power and glory. When the glory of the Lord’s presence was manifest on the mountain, the children of Israel were unprepared and very afraid. Only those who were righteous were permitted to ascend the mount and be in the Lord’s presence (Exodus 24:1, 9-11, 15). <br><br>
Mountains were traditionally considered sacred, because they were closer to God, and immovable. The movement of mountains through earthquake was something that was beyond the capacity of man and signified God’s power, as it did at Mount Sinai. Zenos indicates that divine power would be manifest at the time when the Lord delivered His people from sin and death, similar to the time when He brought the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage. <br><br>
Mount Sinai was a place where the Lord manifested Himself in glory before His people. Those who were unprepared or unworthy could not abide in the divine presence. So Zenos’ prophecy that mountains would be "carried up" at the day of the Lord’s death indicates that something else impossible to mortals would be done by God---His deliverance of man from death.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The Exodus story shows how only the righteous and prepared could abide the Lord’s presence on the mountain. Similarly, as Zenos’ prophecy suggests, only some would be prepared for the Lord’s visitation at the time of His death. When we read about the signs of the Lord’s death in the prophecy of Zenos, we should ponder how we can more fully prepare ourselves for the Lord’s second coming to His covenant people.
