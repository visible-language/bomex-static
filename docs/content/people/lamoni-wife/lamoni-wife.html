The wife of King Lamoni speaks only 151 words. She is the only speaker in the Book of Mormon who uses the words "O blessed God" or "O blessed Jesus" to refer to Deity (Alma 19:29). She also exclaims that Christ has "saved me from an awful hell" and affirms to Ammon, "thou art a prophet." These words and phrases show her to be a woman with an acute and joyous understanding of the blessings of salvation that our Redeemer provides. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>One is struck by the joyous phrases that seem to burst from the lips of this remarkable faithful woman. As we read her words, we should ponder how her faith in the words of the prophet Ammon brought such joy into her life, and how our own faithful obedience to the teachings of Christ through his latter-day servants can also bring us such exquisite happiness.
