Laman and Lemuel use the words "we knew" when they assert Nephi’s lack of abilities (1 Nephi 17:19). They also use to the words "we know" when they assert that the people of Jerusalem were a righteous people, wrongly judged by their father (1 Nephi 17:22). Nephi responds to his brothers by reminding them what they know. "<b><i>Ye know</i></b> that the children of Israel were in bondage; and <b><i>ye know</i></b> that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, <b><i>ye know</i></b> that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage" (1 Nephi 17:25). He also reminds them of Moses� divine call, which was much like their father’s. "<b><i>Ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord</i></b>" (1 Nephi 17:26). He also uses the words <b><i>"ye know"</i></b> to remind them of the miracles God performed through Moses (1 Nephi 17:26-29, 42). Nephi uses the phrases <b><i>"ye know"</i></b> and <b><i>"ye also know"</i></b> eleven times in his defense. <br><br>
When speaking of his own knowledge, Nephi says, "I know not but they [the people at Jerusalem] are at this day about to be destroyed," but then testifies that "<b><i>I know</i></b> that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed" (1 Nephi 17:43). Unlike his brothers, who say they know things that are really false, Nephi testifies only to what he does actually know. By reminding his brothers of the past experiences of their ancestors, something no Israelite would deny, Nephi is able to draw a parallel with their own family experiences in the wilderness and defend their father’s prophetic leadership.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Nephi used the very words spoken by his brothers to remind them of what they already knew about their past, to encourage them to be more faithful. When we read Nephi’s words responding to the criticisms of his brothers, we should ponder what we can do to remember the great things the Lord has done for each of us in the past, to encourage us to be more obedient in the future.
