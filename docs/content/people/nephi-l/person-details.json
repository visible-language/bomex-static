  "description": "Nephi was the fourth son of Lehi and Sariah, and the brother of Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Jacob, and Joseph. His belief and support of the Lord’s revelations to his father and his determination to be obedient to God often brought him into conflict with his two oldest brothers during their journey to the land of promise. He was the recipient of many visions and revelations of his own. \n\nAfter the death of Lehi, the family divided, and those who were willing to hearken to the commandments of God followed Nephi and became his people. He was both a religious and a political leader. Nephi’s words on the small plates (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi) contain an account of his family’s journey through the wilderness, and some of his visions, prophecies, and teachings.",
