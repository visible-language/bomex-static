Laman and Lemuel complained that they had suffered in the wilderness "because we would <b><i>hearken</i></b> unto his [Father Lehi’s] <b><i>words."</i></b> They also asserted that the people of the land of Jerusalem were a righteous people and that their father had misjudged them (1 Nephi 17:22).  <br><br>
Nephi uses the theme of the divine word to teach his brothers the blessings of hearkening to the words of God through ancient prophets. Their Israelite ancestors would have remained in miserable bondage had they not "<b><i>hearkened</i></b> unto the <b><i>words</i></b> of the Lord," through Moses (1 Nephi 17:23). They were led through the sea by "<b><i>his</i></b> [Moses’] <b><i>word"</i></b> (1 Nephi 17:26).  <br><br>
Miracles were accomplished and mortals were preserved through obedience to the word (1 Nephi 17:29). Rough places were made smooth, smooth places were broken up, and the earth itself would pass away through God’s word (1 Nephi 17:46). "According to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did destroy them; and according to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did lead them; and according to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by <b><i>his word"</i></b> (1 Nephi 17:31). Nephi taught his brothers that the righteous are those who hearken to the word (1 Nephi 17:38). The wicked reject "every word of God" (1 Nephi 17:35) and can become so insensitive that they "[can]not feel his words" (1 Nephi 17:45). Nephi uses "word" or "words" 11 times in his response to his brothers. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>When his brothers complained that they were unhappy because they had hearkened to Lehi’s words in leaving Jerusalem, Nephi reminded them that all blessings come from hearkening to the Lord’s words. The greatest happiness in life comes when we diligently hearken to (in other words, follow) the words of the Lord. As we read Nephi’s words to his brothers, we should ponder how greater obedience to the Lord’s teachings through the prophets can bring us greater happiness.
