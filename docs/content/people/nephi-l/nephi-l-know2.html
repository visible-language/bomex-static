  <td><i><b>We knew</b> that ye could not construct a ship, for <b>we knew</b> that ye were lacking in judgment; wherefore, thou canst not accomplish so great a work </i>(1 Nephi 17:19).<br><br>
  <i>And <b>we know</b> that the people who were in the land of Jerusalem were a <b>righteous</b> people; for they kept the statutes and judgments of the Lord, and all his commandments, according to the law of Moses; wherefore, <b>we know</b> that they are a <b>righteous people</b>; and our father hath judged them, and hath <b>led us away</b> because we would <b>hearken unto his words</b>; yea, and our brother is like unto him </i>(1 Nephi 17:22). </td>
  <td><i>Now <b>ye know</b> that the children of Israel were in bondage; and <b>ye know</b> that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, ye know that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage.
      <br><br>Now <b>ye know</b> that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work; and ye know that by <b>his word</b> the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground.  <br><br>
But <b>ye know</b> that the Egyptians were drowned in the Red Sea, who were the armies of Pharaoh.  <br><br>
And <b>ye also know</b> that they were fed with manna in the wilderness.  <br><br>
Yea, and <b>ye also know</b> that Moses, by <b>his word</b> according to the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their thirst </i>(1 Nephi 17:25-29).<br><br>
  <i>And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, <b>ye know </b>that they were <b>led forth</b> by his matchless power into the land of promise.  <br><br>
And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have become wicked, yea, nearly unto ripeness; and <b>I know not</b> but they are at this day about to be destroyed; for <b>I know</b> that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who shall be led away into captivity </i>(1 Nephi 17:42-43).<br><br>
  <i>And <b>ye also know</b> that by the power of his almighty word he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and <b>ye know</b> that by his word he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts? </i>(1 Nephi 17:46). </td>
