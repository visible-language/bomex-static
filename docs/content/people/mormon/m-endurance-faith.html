The phrase, "endurance of faith," is an example of a binomial pair (where two nouns are linked by a preposition such as "and"). Binomial pairs do not normally appear in the Bible or modern English and appear to be unique to the language of the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
These words highlight the truth that faith in Jesus Christ is not a one-time-only attribute or activity. It requires time and experience to develop and deepen, often in the midst of serious challenges, troubles, and afflictions, which must be endured and overcome. The phrase "endurance of faith" is only used by Mormon (Moroni 8:3) and his son Moroni (Moroni 3:3), suggesting that Moroni may have learned it from his father. Both of these prophets had abundant experience in such endurance as they witnessed the increasing wickedness and ultimate destruction of their people, but faithfully persisted in lives of service, looking forward to future blessings available through Christ. <br><br>
The endurance of faith is encapsulated in Mormon’s counsel to Moroni: "And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God" (Moroni 9:6). It means allowing our faith in Christ and His victory over sin and death to carry us across the gulf of misery and despair (Moroni 9:25-26; Helaman 3:27-30).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The endurance of faith is not passive; it is active persistence in faithful service and righteousness, even in a hard and unrighteous world. Like Mormon and Moroni, we should labor diligently to increase our faith in Jesus Christ, and faithfully persist in lives of service, looking forward to the future blessings available through Christ.
