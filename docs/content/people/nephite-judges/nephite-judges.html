As might be expected, the Nephite judges characteristically use words related to legal matters. This includes the words, "murderer," "crime," "condemn," "condemned," "judge," and "confess." In the 246 words of text attributed to them, these references to legal terms occur over 50 times the rate in the rest of the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
The wicked judges are the only speakers to use the world "detect" and the only Nephite or Lamanite speakers to use the word "confederate" (Helaman 9:20). The only other time that word appears is in the writings of Isaiah, where it appears once (2 Nephi 17:2). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The sample of words attributed to the Nephite judges, although small in size, suggests that they represented a real threat to Nephi. They were familiar with the law and knew how to manipulate it to their own advantage. This helps us to more fully appreciate how the Lord, despite these serious challenges, was able to deliver his prophet from danger. If we rely on the Lord and listen to promptings of the Holy Spirit, we also can be delivered.
