  "description": "During the sixty-ninth year of the reign of the judges, Nephi the son of Helaman mourned the wickedness of his people. The corrupt Gadianton faction, led by wicked judges, had gained sole control of the government. Nephi reproved the people for their rapid slide into wickedness, prophesied their destruction if they did not repent, and announced the murder of the chief judge. Offended by Nephi’s prophecies, the judges unsuccessfully attempted to rally the people against him, and accused him of complicity in the crime. Nephi, through his divine prophetic gift, revealed the true murderer and was fully vindicated.",
