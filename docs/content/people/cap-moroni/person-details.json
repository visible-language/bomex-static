He was appointed chief captain at the age of 25 and served for 17 years (Alma 43:3-4, 16-17; 62:43, 52). The reign of the judges began when he was 7. When he was 12, he would have witnessed the devastating war between the Nephites and the Amlicites and Lamanites, in which tens of thousands of his people were slain, including many women and children (Alma 2:19; 3:1-2; 4:1-3).",
