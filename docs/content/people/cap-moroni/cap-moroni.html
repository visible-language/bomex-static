At the age of 22, he would have witnessed and likely participated in the devastating war against the Lamanites, following the arrival of the Lamanite converts in the land of Jershon. The text indicates that this battle was the most tremendous that had ever occurred among the people of Lehi up until that time, resulting again in the death of "many thousands" (Alma 28:9-12). <br><br>
During his time as chief captain, Moroni directed innovations in defensive armor (Alma 43:18-21; 44:9), fortifications (Alma 48:8; 49:1-25; 50:1-6), and forced relocation and settlement (Alma 50:7-18), designed to reduce casualties. He also pursued a relatively lenient policy toward defeated enemy combatants (Alma 44:19-20; 62:16-17) and prisoners, compared to his enemies. (Compare his actions in Alma 52:38-40; 53:1-5 with those of Ammoron (Alma 56:12).) One can see these significant innovations being motivated by a desire to protect his people from the devastation they had seen in earlier conflicts. One may also wonder if his ascendancy to chief captain at a young age may have been attributed, not only to his own abilities, but also due to the great losses of men and leadership in earlier conflicts. <br><br>
The text also shows Moroni to be a man of God, as well as a great military leader (Alma 48:11-18). He knew and cited scripture (Alma 46:24-26; 60:23). He was faithful to covenants (Alma 44:4, 11; 46:12-23) and he was willing to seek and follow the counsel of prophets like Alma (Alma 43:23-24) and defend them (Alma 46:1-3, 11). He suffered at least one serious injury (Alma 52:35) and there are references to his suffering with his men, "all manner of afflictions of every kind" and "exceedingly great sufferings," including "hunger, thirst, and fatigue" (Alma 60:3). He was a much loved, successful, and effective leader, but it is possible that the physical and psychological demands of his service may have taken their toll, leading to his death the year after his retirement at the relatively early age of 43. <br><br>
