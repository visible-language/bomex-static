As might be expected, Moroni’s language includes words and phrases that echo his violent occupation. He speaks of the "wounded and bleeding" (Alma 60:22), speaks graphically of those who have "bled out their lives" (Alma 60:9), and tells the incalcitrant Zoramite rebel that he would "spill [his] blood upon the ground" (Alma 44:11). He warns the impenitent Ammoron of God’s vengeance, telling of "the <i>sword</i> of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you" (Alma 54:6). <br><br>
Captain Moroni’s use of the word "religion" is statistically significant. Out of the 10 references to "religion" in the Book of Mormon, seven come from the Nephite captain. In fact, in six of those seven, he refers to "our religion." He is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use that phrase. His use of the word "freedom" is also significant.  Of the 29 times the word "freedom" is used by Book of Mormon speakers in 264,000 words, it is spoken by Captain Moroni seven times in only 3067 words.  This means he uses "freedom" over 30 times more frequently than all of the other Book of Mormon speakers.  Obviously, religion and freedom are central to his message.
Only Moroni uses the name "all-powerful God," and he does so specifically in the context of emphasizing how God had blessed his army to be victorious over a superior foe (Alma 44:5). <br><br>
Other words and phrases unique to Moroni include "be up and doing" (Alma 60:24), "inward," "neglected," "slothfulness," "thoughtless," "adhere," "awaits," "bestir," "binds," "bleeding," "conflict," "decayed," "hearkening," "impede," "insurrections," "manage," "operate," "prisoner," "proposed," "redoubled," "spark," "spill," "stated," "stupor," "succored," and "traitors."<br><br>
Moroni was conversant with his scriptural heritage. He quotes from a prophecy from the patriarch Jacob, not found in the Bible, which he applies to his people and their enemies in a covenant ceremony (Alma 46:24-26). He also makes an interesting reference to the practice, under the law of Moses, of the cleansing of vessels (Leviticus 11:32-33; Numbers 19:14-15), indicating that this was a practice known to Moroni and kept by the Nephites under that law (Alma 60:23).<sup>1</sup> <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Moroni’s example shows that one can be a servant of God, even during the most difficult of times. His faith in the words of the prophets, his faithfulness to sacred covenants, and his courage were a great blessing to his people as he defended their liberties and their religion. When we read the words of Moroni, we should ponder how we can develop greater faith and faithfulness in our own lives.
