  "description": "Jarom was the grandson of Jacob and the fourth writer on the small plates of Nephi. He seems to have written at a time of increasing cultural development in the land of Nephi. Although he was a prophet like his father, Enos, he does not provide a great deal of information on the subject of his own prophecies (Jarom 1:2). He does, however, provide insight into the state of Nephite society during this time. While he acknowledges the Lord’s great mercy in blessing the Nephites with riches and preserving them from their enemies (Jarom 1:7–9), his words indicate that without persistent and strenuous prophetic effort, the people would fall quickly into apostasy (Jarom 1:3, 10, 12).",
