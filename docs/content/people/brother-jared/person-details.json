  "description": "The Brother of Jared was a prophet-leader of the Jaredites during their departure from ancient Mesopotamia at the time of the great tower, when languages were confounded (Ether 1:33-40). Under divine guidance, he helped lead a group through the wilderness (Ether 1:41-42; 2:1-13) and eventually across the ocean to a land of promise in the New World (Ether 6:1-12).\n\n He was a man of great faith (Ether 12:29-30). In preparation for their ocean journey, he received a marvelous vision of the Lord’s premortal spirit body and was blessed with a vision of the future, which he was commanded to record and hide up to be revealed to a future generation (Ether 3:6-28). We only have a small selection of his actual words in the book of Ether; they come primarily from his petitions to God in preparation for his journey (Ether 2:18-22; 3:2-12).",
