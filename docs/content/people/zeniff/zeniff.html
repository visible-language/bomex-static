As might be expected of a ruler, Zeniff’s favored words revolve around his lands, possessions, and people, but also God, as a source of strength in battle. Only Zeniff uses the words "austere" (1), "collected" (1), "depended" (1), "forty-three" (1), "invent" (1), "lazy" (1), "leathern" (1), "neas" (1), "sheum" (1), "rescued" (1), "ruling" (1), "seventy-nine" (1), "shaved" (1), "stimulate" (1), "tend" (1), and "unawares" (1). <br><br>
"Over-zealous" is notable as a word Zeniff applies to himself (Mosiah 9:3). Limhi is the only other Book of Mormon speaker to use this word and he does so in reference to his grandfather (Mosiah 7:21). The word suggests an excessive desire to achieve a particular goal. <br><br>
Zeniff begins his account in language that recalls the beginning of Nephi’s record (Mosiah 9:1; 1 Nephi 1:1). Like Nephi, Zeniff begins in the first person and gives his name. Both writers speak of "having been" twice, and "having had." Nephi speaks of "having <b><i>seen</i></b> many afflictions in the course of my days" and Zeniff says, "I <b><i>saw</i></b> that which was good" among the Lamanites.  <br><br>
Both Nephi and Zeniff speak of what they were taught. For Nephi, these teachings included the language of his father Lehi. Zeniff says he was taught in "all the language of the Nephites." Each writer mentions his <b><i>knowledge</i></b> of various matters and both speak of having obtained knowledge of something <b><i>good.</i></b> Nephi is born of <b><i>goodly</i></b> parents and has obtained a knowledge of the <b><i>goodness</i></b> and mysteries of God, while Zeniff refuses to destroy the Lamanites when he sees "that which was <b><i>good</i></b> among them." Both writers conclude their introductions with the word "therefore" and go on to tell their respective stories. <br><br>
While Zeniff evokes the language of Nephi, his words suggest that he falls short of his ancestor’s achievements. Zeniff possesses "a knowledge of the land of his father’s first inheritance," while Nephi possessed a "knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God," something that Zeniff does not claim. Zeniff says his group "began to multiply and prosper in the land" (Mosiah 9:9), while Nephi said that his people "began to proper <i>exceedingly"</i> (2 Nephi 5:13). With prophetic wisdom and foresight, Nephi prepared his people with weapons to defend against their Lamanite enemies (2 Nephi 5:14). Zeniff is at first deceived by King Laman and is caught off guard, but quickly prepares weapons for the defense of his people (Mosiah 9:16).  <br><br>
Only a generation earlier, Mosiah I had been commanded by God to leave that land with "as many as would hearken unto the voice of the Lord" (Omni 1:12-13). Zeniff has honorable qualities, but is not a prophet or seer like Mosiah I (Omni 1:20), and lacks a divine mandate to return. In retrospect, he attributes his actions to his own overzealousness, rather than to wisdom (Mosiah 9:3). He realizes that his myopic determination to return to the land of his fathers blinded him to the deceptions of his enemies and placed his people in a dangerous and precarious situation.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Zeniff’s account shows how determination to achieve a goal, which ignores the counsel of the Lord’s prophets, can blind us to the deceptions and evil plans of others and place us in serious danger. However, it also shows that when we awake to a remembrance of God, and call upon Him for help, He can strengthen us even in difficult situations.
