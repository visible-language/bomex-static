When Laman and Lemuel murmur against their father Lehi, they accuse him of being led by the "foolish <b><i>imaginations of his heart"</i></b> (1 Nephi 2:11; 17:20). The brothers’ contemporary Jeremiah used a similar phrase in early prophecies against his people. The phrase "<b><i>imagination of his heart"</i></b> or "<b><i>imagination of their heart"</i></b> appears ten times in the writings of that prophet (Jeremiah 7:24; 9:14; 11:8; 13:10; 16:12; 18:12; 23:17), twice elsewhere (Deuteronomy 29:19; Psalms 81:12), and nowhere else. Its prevalence in Jeremiah’s prophecies indicates that the phrase was an important theme of the time and would likely have been familiar to Lehi’s family. It was tied to the events of the Exodus, when Israel rebelled against God and suffered in the wilderness. <br><br>
Jeremiah also uses the phrase in his warning against the false prophets who were deceiving the people with false dreams, saying, "I have dreamed, I have dreamed" (Jeremiah 23:25), and "speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord" (Jeremiah 23:16). In contrast to Jeremiah, who warned of coming destruction for the unrepentant, the false prophets proclaimed peace, and said to "everyone that walketh after the <b><i>imagination of his own heart,</i></b> no evil shall come upon you" (Jeremiah 23:17). <br><br>
When Laman and Lemuel applied these words to their father and their brother Nephi, they were not simply calling them fools. They were accusing them of being false prophets, like those condemned by Jeremiah. This was ironic, since those false prophets, like Laman and Lemuel, rejected true prophets and did not believe Jerusalem could be destroyed. Jeremiah taught that, unlike the false prophets of his day, he had stood in the Lord’s heavenly council to receive his prophetic message (Jeremiah 23:21-22). Lehi had done the same (1 Nephi 1:8-14). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Because individuals sometimes wrest or misrepresent prophetic words, it is important to gain a testimony from the Holy Ghost of living prophets and their teachings, to prepare our minds, soften our hearts, and help us to recognize important truths and follow their counsel (1 Nephi 2:16-18).
