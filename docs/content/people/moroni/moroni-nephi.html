Moroni’s words show a significant influence from the small plates of Nephi, as he sometimes quotes from or paraphrases from that record. Such phrases include, "the blood of saints shall cry" (Mormon 8:27; 2 Nephi 26:3; 28:9-10), and his reference to a scripture that says "God is the same yesterday, today, and forever" (Mormon 9:9; Moroni 10:19; 1 Nephi 10:18). <br><br>
His description of the final judgment seems to draw upon the language of Jacob, when he uses the phrases, "And then cometh the judgment," that the "filthy shall be filthy still" and the "righteous shall be righteous still" (Mormon 9:14; 2 Nephi 9:15-16). Moroni, however, adds the meaningful words, "he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still" (Mormon 9:14).  <br><br>
Moroni’s critique of those who ignore the poor and needy might have been influenced by Nephi’s teaching. Both speak of "pride," neglect of the "poor," and a materialistic focus on "fine" things, including clothing and church adornment, which infect all "save a few" (Mormon 8:36-37; "save it be a few," 2 Nephi 28:11-14). His reference to those who justify sin (Mormon 8:31) may also echo Nephi’s words on the same theme. <br><br>
Moroni writes that the time will come that "Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men" (Ether 8:26), which nearly matches Nephi’s prophecy, "Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time" (2 Nephi 30:18; 1 Nephi 22:15, 26). They also share a scripture that says the first shall be last and the last shall be first (Ether 13:12; 1 Nephi 13:42; Jacob 5:63). <br><br>
In his final farewell, Moroni says his words help to fulfill earlier prophecies that they shall "proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God" and that "his word shall hiss forth" (Moroni 10:28). The prophecy seems to refer to the Lord’s words spoken to Nephi that "the words of your seed should proceed out of my mouth unto your seed; and my words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth" (2 Nephi 29:2; 25:21-22).  <br><br>
It is especially interesting that Moroni evokes words and images from Jacob’s and Nephi’s farewells when he speaks of meeting readers at the "bar" of God, "as one speaking out of the dust" (Moroni 10:27-28; "as one crying from the dust" (2 Nephi 33:11, 13). Like Jacob, Moroni wants to "meet you before the pleasing bar" of God (Moroni 10:34; Jacob 6:13).  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Moroni’s words show that he was familiar with and pondered the teachings of earlier prophets, whose writings were inscribed on the small plates that his father Mormon had included in the Book of Mormon. His words show a clear affinity with the earlier words of Nephi. As we read Moroni’s words, we should ponder how a familiarity with the teachings of the prophets can enlighten our perspectives and help us to find joy and peace in times of loneliness and difficulty, as they did for Moroni.
