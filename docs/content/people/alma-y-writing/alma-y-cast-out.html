During his mission to the land of Antionum, Alma encountered a group of Zoramites who had been "cast out" of the synagogues because of their poverty (Alma 32:2). The spokesman for this group of outcasts asked Alma: <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have <b><i>cast us out</i></b> of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have <b><i>cast us out</i></b> because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do? </i>(Alma 32:5).</p> <br><br>
As a master teacher, Alma helps the Zoramite poor to understand the importance of heeding the gospel message by incorporating the image of being "cast out" in his sermon on faith. Alma and Amulek actually use the words "cast out" or "cast away" 11 times in their sermons (Alma 32:9, 12, 24, 28, 32, 38; 33:10; 34:29, 40).   <br><br>
Alma likens faith in the words of Christ to a seed that we should plant in our hearts. He invites these Zoramites, who said they had "no <b><i>place</i></b>" to worship God, to "<b><i>give place</i></b>" in their own hearts to test the goodness of his words. Alma teaches, "Now, if ye <b><i>give place,</i></b> that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not <b><i>cast it out</i></b> by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts" (Alma 32:28). A seed that grows is good, but a seed that does not grow is bad and is "<b><i>cast away</i></b>" (Alma 32:32).  <br><br>
Further evidence of the goodness of the word is found as this growth continues; but if one fails to nourish one’s faith, it will wither away and die, and one will "<b><i>cast it out</i></b>" (Alma 32:38). This is not because the word of Christ was bad or undesirable, but because the hearer failed to diligently care for and nourish faith in the word (Alma 32:39). Through diligence, patience, and consistent nourishment, the seed will grow into a tree and bear the fruit of happiness and eternal life, which is most precious and desirable above all other things (Alma 32:41-43). In his teachings on prayer, Alma cites the words of Zenos who had also been "<b><i>cast out</i></b>" (Alma 33:10), but found mercy through the Son of God (Alma 33:11). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The Zoramite poor felt very keenly the injustice of being "cast out" and treated as if they had no worth. By incorporating this idea into his sermon, Alma helps his listeners relate to his teachings by underscoring the value of his teachings, and the wrongness of dismissing the words of Christ and casting them away as if they were nothing. As we read Alma’s teachings to the Zoramites, we should ponder how we can more fully cherish, nourish, and act in faith upon the words of Christ to obtain greater happiness in this life and eternal life in the world to come.
