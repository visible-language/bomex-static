Alma’s use of the noun "state" to refer to the various conditions of the soul (35 times) is significant. This is about ten times as often as any other writer. Alma often concentrates this word within a cluster of verses in his sermons. In his teachings to Corianton, "state" occurs nine times in Alma 40:11-15, six times in Alma 41:11-12, and six times in Alma 42:10-13.  <br><br>
Alma also uses the term "state" to reword various conditions. He first speaks of mortality as a probationary "time" (Alma 42:4) and then rewords this as a probationary "state" (Alma 42:10, 13). The people of Zarahemla were in an "awful dilemma" (Alma 7:3), which he then rewords as a "state of dilemma" (Alma 7:18). When he discusses the principle of agency, in contrast to Lehi (2 Nephi 2:26-28), Jacob (2 Nephi 10:23), and Samuel (Helaman 14:30-31), Alma describes man as being placed in a "state to act" (Alma 12:31), as opposed to simply being "free" or "free to choose." This usage also distinguishes Alma from discussions of agency in the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price (Doctrine and Covenants 29:35-39; 58:27-28; 93:30-31; 107:78; Moses 6:56). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Sometimes the unique emphasis of a Book of Mormon speaker points us to a facet of the plan of salvation that we might need to understand. Alma’s distinctive use of the term "state" emphasizes the <b><i>condition</i></b> in which the Lord has placed us to exercise our gift of agency. As we read Alma’s words, we should ponder how we can more fully act in faith, in our mortal state and in the individual daily circumstances of our lives.
