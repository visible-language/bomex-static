  <h1 class="content-title">Lamanite kings: Lamanite Kings: Lamoni, His Father, and Anti-Nephi-Lehi</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">The Book of Mormon contains words from three Lamanite kings, who were miraculously converted through the examples and teachings of Ammon, Aaron, and their fellow missionaries. These include King Lamoni, his father, and King Anti-Nephi-Lehi. Lamoni was king over the people in the land of Ishmael and a descendant of Ishmael (Alma 17:19, 21). At this time, Lamoni&#x27;s father was king over all the Lamanites in the land of Nephi. When Lamoni&#x27;s father died, his son Anti-Nephi-Lehi became king.</p>
<div class="analysis">
These men were kings during the fourteen-year mission of Ammon and his brethren around 90-77 BC. Each of these kings was a convert to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, along with many thousands of their people. These conversions were remarkable because the Lamanites had previously been inveterate enemies of the Nephites for hundreds of years. This led to dramatic political and social changes among the people of Lehi.<br><br>
Alma taught his son Helaman that Nephite scriptures, including the plates of Nephi, were one of the keys to the Lamanites’ conversion.<br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%"><i>Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect traditions of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer </i>(Alma 37:9).</p>

      <p>
We, of course, do not have a full account of all the teachings of the sons of Mosiah among the Lamanites; however, there is evidence in the selection of words we do have, of the truthfulness of Alma’s observation that the words and ideas that the missionaries taught were incorporated into the language of these Lamanite kings. Consider the following ideas: 
<ol>
<li> God is a Great Spirit,</li>
<li> The idea that a portion of the Spirit of God can dwell within the righteous,</li>
<li> The teaching that salvation from even the most awful sins is possible through the merits of the Son of God, and </li>
<li> The practice of bowing down before God. </li>
</ol>
Each of these is discussed in a separate cameo.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>A comparison of the teachings of the Nephite missionaries with the language used by the converted Lamanite kings demonstrates the impact of the words of the Nephite missionaries on those they taught. When we read the story of Ammon, his brethren, and their missionary activities, we should ponder the impact of their words, and how those words could lead to such a mighty change in the hearts of those who responded to them. Can we experience such a mighty change in our hearts?
