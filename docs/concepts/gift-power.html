The phrase "gift and power" is an example of a binomial pair (two nouns linked by a preposition, such as "and"). This phrase never appears in the King James Bible, but is unique to the Book of Mormon and the revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants. <br><br>
All uses of "gift and power" in the Book of Mormon refer to blessings that come from God. They refer to His words and those of ancient prophets, which could not otherwise be known. Mormon’s record on the plates, for example, was "to come forth by the <b><i>gift and power</i></b> of God unto the interpretation thereof" (Title Page of the Book of Mormon). Amaleki said that the seer king Mosiah I interpreted the enigmatic engravings on the Jaredite stone "by the <b><i>gift and power</i></b> of God" (Omni 1:20). The Lord also told Nephi that his people would "write many things which I shall minister unto them" and that these things would "be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the <b><i>gift and power</i></b> of the Lamb" (1 Nephi 13:35). <br><br>
In addition to the Lord’s words, "gift and power" refers to the divine endowment graciously bestowed upon those who strive to serve God and accomplish His work in difficult times and circumstances. The latter-day Gentiles who labor to establish Zion will be blessed because "they shall have the <b><i>gift and power</i></b> of the Holy Ghost" (1 Nephi 13:37). <br><br>
In fact, as Mormon teaches, <b><i>everything</i></b> that persuades, invites people to do good, and believe and follow Christ is "sent forth by the <b><i>power and gift</i></b> of Christ" (Moroni 7:16).<br><br>
The phrase "gift and power" conveys the truth that the Lord is the source of grace and mercy to His children, which we do not deserve, as well as strength and miraculous means, beyond our individual capacities, to accomplish what He requires in His service. Joseph Smith was weak and unlearned, but through the gift and power of God, translated the Book of Mormon from a language he could not read, and published it to the world. That miracle blesses the lives of millions of readers today.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>As we look to God, and appeal to Him for strength and the means to obediently serve Him, He provides the gifts we need to perfect our weaknesses through our faith in Christ. When we read the words "gift and power" in the Book of Mormon, it is good to reflect on how many ways the Lord has blessed each of us from the beginning, and continues to bless us each day, helping us to "remember how merciful the Lord has been unto the children of men" (Moroni 10:3).
