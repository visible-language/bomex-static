  <h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Lehi’s hopes for Laman and Lemuel, which were not fulfilled in his lifetime, were realized hundreds of years later in the lives of their descendants?</h3>
<div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Lehi and his family dwelt in the valley of Lemuel, he spoke to his rebellious sons Laman and Lemuel. "And it came to pass that he spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, <b>firm</b> and <b>steadfast,</b> and <b>immovable</b> in <b>keeping the commandments</b> of the Lord!" (1 Nephi 2:10). While at times showing signs of righteous behavior, Laman and Lemuel did not live up to the hopes of their prophetic father, but continued to rebel against his counsel and teachings and those of their brother Nephi. 
One of the tragic consequences of their unrighteous choices was that many generations of their children dwindled in unbelief. Lehi found comfort in the holy covenants he had made with the Lord, and was shown that at a future day, the children of these rebellious parents would be blessed. <br><br>
Mormon recounts a serious Nephite apostasy that preceded the visitation of the resurrected Jesus to the land of promise. He related how, just a few years after being miraculously delivered by the Lord from destruction at the hands of their enemies, the people of Nephi yielded to temptation and became proud and grossly wicked. <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>In the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were <b>firm,</b> and <b>steadfast,</b> and <b>immovable,</b> willing with all diligence to <b>keep the commandments</b> of the Lord </i>(3 Nephi 6:14). <p><br>
The language Mormon uses in this narrative is striking because it evokes the language spoken by Lehi hundreds of years before. Lehi’s hopes concerning Laman and Lemuel, never realized in his lifetime, were fulfilled at a hinge point in Lehite history, where the faithfulness and steadfastness of a few converted Lamanites were true to the faith of their righteous grandfather. This faithfulness at a time of serious wickedness became a nucleus around which the Church could again be built up, preparing a people who were ready to receive the visitation of the resurrected Jesus. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Mormon’s use of Lehi’s words highlights one of the key purposes of the Book of Mormon: That the Lord’s people, including the children of Father Lehi, "may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever" (Book of Mormon Title Page). The Lord fulfilled his covenant promises to Lehi. Even though Lehi did not live to see them fulfilled in the lives of his rebellious children, they were fulfilled many years later, in the lives of his sons’ descendants.  <br><br>
This shows that the Lord blesses parents who are faithful to their covenants, even when they experience profound disappointment in the unrighteous choices of their children. The Lord keeps all His promises to the faithful, in His own time and in His own way.
