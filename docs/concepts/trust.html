      <p>
The word "trust" occurs throughout the Book of Mormon. It is used a total of 44 times by 14 different speakers, from Nephi to Moroni. Those who most use the word include Alma the Younger (11 times), Mormon (8 times), Nephi I (6 times), Helaman (4 times), and Limhi (3 times). Alma the Elder, Isaiah, and the Lord each use the word twice, while King Benjamin, Jacob, Moroni, Mosiah, Pahoran, and Zeniff each use the term once. <br><br>
"Trust" appears six times in reference to trusting a particular person, or having certain expectations about a person, as when Alma tells his son Shiblon, "I trust that I shall have great joy in you" (Alma 38:2), or when Mormon tells Moroni, "I trust that I may see thee soon" (Moroni 9:24).<br><br>
Most references to trust, however, refer directly or indirectly to trusting in God. Out of the 44 times the word is used, 28 refer to having trust in the Lord, including the words, "trusting," "trusted," or having trust because of God. King Limhi, for example, taught his people to "Rejoice, and put your trust in God" (Mosiah 7:19), and Alma taught Helaman, "whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions" (Alma 36:3).<br><br>
In addition to this, speakers admonish the reader not to trust in man, the arm of the flesh, riches, or idols 10 times. This means that the majority of times the word is used in the text (38 out of the 44 times), it denotes putting trust in God and not man or worldly things.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Trust means having faith in the Lord. When we examine the passages in the text that admonish us to trust God, we find promises of blessings that will come from our faith, as they did to those in the Book of Mormon. These blessings include help to overcome our fears (2 Nephi 22:2) and deliverance from trials, troubles, afflictions (Alma 36:3; 38:5), bondage, death (Mosiah 7:33; Alma 36:27), and enemies (2 Nephi 4:33; Jacob 7:25). <br><br>
Prophets also teach that those who put their trust in God, rather than temporary or worldly things, receive mercy (Mosiah 29:20), eternal salvation (Mosiah 4:6), and the promise that they will be lifted up at the last day (Alma 36:3; 38:5). When discouraged, Nephi reminded himself of the blessings he had experienced in the past as a result of putting his trust in God, and found strength to continue (2 Nephi 4:17-35). Trusting in God brings us power to endure faithfully, and to learn from, and eventually overcome, the challenges we face in our lives.
