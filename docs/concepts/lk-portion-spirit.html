Before he was taught the gospel, King Lamoni wondered how Ammon could have such great power and knowledge, without being the Great Spirit. Ammon explained that he was only a man, but that God, in His great mercy, could bless those who served Him with great gifts, when necessary. Ammon explained, "<b><i>A portion of that Spirit</i></b> dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge" (Alma 18:35). <br><br>
Significantly, Lamoni’s brother, King Anti-Nephi-Lehi also uses this phrase when he says, "I thank my great God that he has given us <b><i>a portion of his Spirit</i></b> to soften our hearts" (Alma 24:8). Ammon’s phrase was a helpful way of explaining to recent converts how an all-powerful God could extend His power to those who are imperfect, but who love Him and seek to serve Him.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>The Lamanites, like the missionary Ammon, were not perfect, but wanted to serve God and do better. Knowing that we can be blessed with a portion of God’s Spirit to bless, help, and guide us is encouraging, and can increase our hope and strengthen our faith in and love for God.
