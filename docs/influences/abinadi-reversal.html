<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Abinadi and Isaiah: Who Are the Lord’s People?</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Abinadi references passages in Isaiah that explain that the Lord’s people are those who hearken to His laws?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Those who read Abinadi’s words may wonder how his teachings and his response to the priests’ questions relate to the words of Isaiah. In his defense before King Noah and his priests, Abinadi is asked to explain the meaning of Isaiah 52:7-10, in light of his negative prophecies about them and the people. Noah, his priests, and his people thought of themselves as righteous, and presumptively applied the blessings mentioned by Isaiah to themselves. In response, Abinadi expounded upon this passage, but also drew upon other parts of Isaiah that surround the passage in question. Readers of Abinadi’s words can be rewarded by noting key words and phrases that are used by both prophets (See <i>Chart on the Words of Abinadi and Isaiah</i>). <br><br>
Both Isaiah and Abinadi refer to "his people" and "my people." <b><i>Who</i></b> are the Lord’s people? Both Isaiah and Abinadi make clear that it is those who trust in Him, "hearken" and "give ear" to his law and commandments (Isaiah 51:1, 4-5, 7; Mosiah 15:11), and "in whose heart is my law" (Isaiah 51:7). Abinadi seems to reference this passage when, after noting the priests’ refusal to keep the law of Moses, he cites the ten commandments, "for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts" (Mosiah 13:11). It is interesting that Abinadi references the version of the Isaiah passage on the small plates of Nephi, cited years earlier by Jacob, which reads "in whose heart I have <b><i>written</i></b> my law" (2 Nephi 8:7), rather than the one from our current Bible (Isaiah 51:7).<br><br>
Christ suffered and bore the transgressions of His people (those who hearken to Him and keep His commandments) and He makes "intercession" for them (Isaiah 53:12; Mosiah 15:8-9). Isaiah taught that the Lord "pleadeth the cause of his people" (Isaiah 51:22). This merciful intercession is available to those who hearken to His words, but can be refused by those who rebel and go on in the ways of sin (Mosiah 15:26-27; 16:5, 12). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>As we read and study Abinadi’s words, we should ask ourselves how Isaiah’s words would have answered the questions asked by Noah’s priests. We should also ponder what our daily behavior says about our relationship to the Lord. Does our behavior show that we are His people?

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Abinadi’s Warning to Noah and His People: A Reversal of the Exodus</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Abinadi warned Noah and his people that the Lord would reverse the blessings of the Exodus for them, if they did not repent?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The first time Abinadi preached to the people of King Noah, he prophesied that if they did not repent, they would be brought into bondage. His words evoke those of the Lord to Moses, during his call to deliver Israel out of Egypt (Exodus 3:7-9, 16-17), but are used in a way that conveys a dramatic reversal of the Exodus for Noah’s people (Mosiah 11:20). The Lord told Moses, "I have <b><i>seen</i></b> the affliction of my people," "<b><i>seen</i></b> the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them," and "<b><i>seen</i></b> that which is done to you in Egypt." Through Abinadi, however, the Lord offers a negative variation of these words to Noah and his people: "I have <b><i>seen</i></b> their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms" (Mosiah 11:20; also compare what the Lord says of Jerusalem in 1 Nephi 1:13 and Jeremiah 13:27). <br><br>
The Lord told Moses He had "<b><i>heard</i></b> their cry by reason of their taskmasters" and would come down "to <b><i>deliver them out</i></b> of the hand of the Egyptians." The Lord told Noah and his people that He would "<b><i>deliver them into</i></b> the hands of their enemies" and that they would be "brought <b><i>into</i></b> bondage" (Mosiah 11:21). In contrast to Israel in Egypt, "I will be <b><i>slow to hear</i></b> their cries" and "I <b><i>will not hear</i></b> their prayers, <b><i>neither will I deliver them out</i></b> of their afflictions," unless they repent (Mosiah 11:24-25). The Lord told Moses and Israel, "I have surely <b><i>visited</i></b> you" to deliver them from Egypt. The Lord told Abinadi, "I will <b><i>visit</i></b> them in mine anger" (Mosiah 11:20). <br><br>
God said to ancient Israel, "ye shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord your God"</i></b> (Exodus 6:7). Of Noah and his people, He said, "they shall <b><i>know that I am the Lord their God"</i></b> (Mosiah 11:22). When the Lord gave the ten commandments, He warned, "I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquity</i></b> of the fathers upon the children" (Exodus 20:5). To Noah’s people, He said, "they shall know that I am a jealous God, <b><i>visiting the iniquities</i></b> of my people" (Mosiah 11:22). <br><br>
Noah’s words, "<b><i>Who</i></b> is Abinadi that I and my people should be <b><i>judged</i></b> of him?" (Mosiah 11:27), echo those of the ungrateful Israelite who asked Moses, "<b><i>Who</i></b> madest thee a prince and a <b><i>judge</i></b> over us?" (Exodus 2:14). When King Noah asks, "<b><i>Who is the Lord</i></b> that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?" (Mosiah 11:27), he is portrayed like Pharaoh, who asked, "<b><i>Who is the Lord,</i></b> that I should obey his voice to let Israel go?" (Exodus 5:2), and like Pharaoh, "<b><i>hardened</i></b> his heart" (Mosiah 11:29; compare Exodus 7:13). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The wickedness and sins of King Noah and his people are characterized in Abinadi’s prophecy as a form of bondage. Noah and his priests are placed in the roles of Pharaoh and the Egyptian taskmasters. The Exodus blessings are turned on their heads because of the rebellion of the Nephite colony and their leaders. As we read Abinadi’s words, we should ponder how our own sins and rebellion against God limit our happiness and opportunities to grow. If we turn to God, we increase our freedom and our ability to experience greater joy.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Abinadi’s Warning: Smitten Like the Egyptians</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that when King Noah’s people rejected the Lord’s prophetic warning, he smote them with plagues like those suffered by the Egyptians?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Abinadi’s words on his second mission to Noah and his people draws upon the language in Exodus, in which the Lord smote the Egyptians with various plagues. The Lord warned the unrepentant Noah, like the recalcitrant Pharaoh (Exodus 7:5; 14:4, 18), that he "<b><i>shall know that I am the Lord"</i></b> (Mosiah 12:3). God told Pharaoh, "I will stretch out my hand, that I may <b><i>smite thee and thy people with pestilence;</i></b> and thou shalt be <b><i>cut off from the earth"</i></b> (Exodus 9:14-15). The Lord told Noah’s people, "I will <b><i>smite this my people</i></b> with sore afflictions, yea, with famine and with <b><i>pestilence"</i></b> and that, "except they repent I will <b><i>utterly destroy them"</i></b> (Mosiah 12:4, 7-8). Both groups were smitten with "<b><i>hail"</i></b> (Exodus 9:22; Mosiah 12:6), the "<b><i>east wind,"</i></b> and insects that would "pester their land . . . and devour their grain" (Mosiah 12:6; Exodus 8:16-24). <br><br> 
A second notable connection is when Moses took ashes from the furnace, sprinkled them toward heaven, and the Egyptians were cursed with boils and blains (Exodus 9:10). Israel, however, was promised that if they would diligently hearken to God, "I will put none of these <b><i>diseases</i></b> upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee" (Exodus 15:26; see also Deuteronomy 28:60). When Abinadi is suffering death by fire he tells the priests, "<b><i>ye</i></b> shall be afflicted with all manner of <b><i>diseases</i></b> because of your iniquities" (Mosiah 17:14-16). <br><br>
Abinadi taught Noah and his priests from the words of Isaiah, which explained that Christ would suffer and bear the transgressions of his people (those who hearken) and makes "intercession" for them. Significantly, Noah’s priests, who rejected Christ, who was familiar with man’s infirmities and sicknesses (Isaiah 53:3-4; Mosiah 14:3-4), are "smitten with all manner of diseases because of their iniquities" (Mosiah 17:16).
<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>When Noah and his people rejected Abinadi’s prophetic warning and refused to repent, they were smitten like the Egyptians and Pharaoh, who hardened their hearts against the Lord and Moses. Their lives became increasingly worse to the degree that they rebelled against God. When we read Abinadi’s words, we should ponder how daily repentance and following the counsel of living prophets and apostles can increase the blessings in our lives. Having carried our sorrows and infirmities, our Savior is always ready to bless us with healing and love, as soon as we are willing to turn to Him.
