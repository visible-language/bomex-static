  <h1 class="content-title">The Influence of Nephi’s Words on King Benjamin’s Teachings to His Sons</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">The first chapter of Mosiah contains some of the teachings that King Benjamin taught his sons. Benjamin was the custodian of the plates that had been kept and preserved by his ancestors, including the small plates of Nephi (Omni 1:25). A comparison between Benjamin’s words in Mosiah 1 and those in 1 Nephi shows that the Nephite king was strongly influenced by his ancestor.</p>

King Benjamin taught his sons how the records on the plates of brass enabled them to have the Lord’s commandments always "before our eyes," and that if this had not been the case, "even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief" (Mosiah 1:5). He then reaffirmed to them that those records were true "and we can know of their surety because we have them <b><i>before our eyes"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:6). Only King Benjamin uses this phrase, and he emphasized to his sons that this was something they were to "remember" (Mosiah 1:5-6). It is interesting that Benjamin links having the commandments in the scriptures <b><i>before our eyes</i></b> with knowing that those words are true. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s teachings show that the Lord’s commandments light the way for us. However, where a record of those commandments is missing, future generations become blind, dwindle in unbelief, and fail in their potential for good. When the people of Nephi kept the Lord’s words before their eyes, they remembered God and prospered in their ways. They could thereby know the truth of his words from day to day, as they were continually reminded of it, lived it, and loved the truth as the foundation of their peace. <br><br>
As we read Benjamin’s words, we should ask ourselves how we can always keep the Lord’s words "before our eyes" so that the words of Christ can penetrate our hearts and provide daily light, as we walk in the covenant path.

When Nephi pondered whether or not he should slay Laban, the Spirit taught him, "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should <b><i>dwindle</i></b> and perish <b><i>in unbelief"</i></b> (1 Nephi 4:13). Benjamin echoes these earlier words when he explains to his sons, "Were it not for these things . . . even our fathers would have <b><i>dwindled in unbelief,</i></b> and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things" (Mosiah 1:5). <br><br>
Key Insights <br><br>
Both Benjamin and Nephi recorded the tragic effects of scriptural illiteracy upon subsequent generations. As we read the teachings of King Benjamin, we should ask ourselves if we are doing all that we can to teach and perpetuate our scriptural heritage to the rising generation.

During his mission to obtain the plates of brass, Nephi says, "I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall <b><i>keep my commandments,</i></b> they shall <b><i>prosper in the land</i></b> of promise. Yea, and I also thought that <b><i>they could not keep the commandments</i></b> of the Lord, according to the law of Moses, <b><i>save they should have the law.</i></b> And I also knew that <b><i>the law was engraven upon the plates</i></b> of brass (1 Nephi 4:14-16). After successfully obtaining the record, he observed, "We could <b><i>preserve the commandments of the Lord</i></b> unto our children (1 Nephi 5:21). <br><br>
King Benjamin taught his sons, "I would that ye should remember that <b><i>were it not for these plates,</i></b> which contain these records and these <b><i>commandments,</i></b> we must have suffered in ignorance" (Mosiah 1:3). "<b><i>For it were not possible</i></b> that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, <b><i>except it were for the help of these plates"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:4). He also reminded them of the importance of those scriptures "which have been kept and <b><i>preserved</></b> by the hand of God," which enabled them to "<b><i>have his commandments"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:5) and "<b><i>keep the commandments of God,</i></b> that [they might] <b><i>prosper in the land"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:7). Both prophets emphasized that knowing and keeping the commandments would have been impossible, if the record had not been preserved.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Without written scriptures, the people of Lehi would have not been able to preserve a knowledge of the commandments, but would have had the same problem experienced by the people of Zarahemla who, because of their lack of records, "denied the being of their Creator" (Omni 1:17). As we read the teachings of Benjamin to his sons, we should consider how we can effectively preserve and internalize a knowledge of the commandments in our own families.

      <p>
Nephi, in his efforts to persuade and encourage his brothers, said, "And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children, <b><i>the language of our fathers"</i></b> (1 Nephi 3:19). Benjamin taught his three sons, "For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to <b><i>his children,</i></b> except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in <b><i>the language of the Egyptians</i></b> therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to <b><i>his children,</i></b> that thereby they could teach them to <b><i>their children"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:4). Both prophets highlight the essential role the plates of brass played in preserving the language among their children. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Both Nephi and Benjamin emphasized how the scriptures helped to pass on an understanding of the language they were written in. Unlike Lehi and Benjamin’s children, most current readers of the Book of Mormon are not trained in the Egyptian language; however, the written words of the ancient prophets help us to become literate in the language of God’s ways. They can help those who receive and follow them understand and recognize the language of the Spirit of the Lord.  <br><br>
As we study the words of King Benjamin, we should ponder how these teachings can help us to become more responsive when the Spirit of the Lord speaks to us.

      Nephi outlined various ways that the scriptures on the plates of brass would be a blessing to Lehi’s posterity. They would <br><br>
<ol>
<li>help in preserving the language of their fathers, </li>
<li>enable them to know the commandments of God so they could keep them,  </li>
<li>prevent them from dwindling in unbelief,  </li>
<li>enable them to know the mysteries of God, and  </li>
<li>enable them to know that the records were true.  </li>
</ol>
Benjamin’s counsel to his sons touches upon each of these points, as shown in the chart below.<br><br>
Key Insights <br><br>
The evidence for the influence of Nephi’s words upon Benjamin makes sense and is consistent with what the Book of Mormon states, because Benjamin had possession of those records. It is generally held by historians, however (both by believers and non-believers in the Book of Mormon account), that the book of Mosiah was dictated by Joseph Smith <b><i>before</i></b> 1 Nephi.<sup>1</sup>  Were the Book of Mormon a work of fiction by Joseph Smith, it would have been difficult for him to have remembered Nephi’s words before he dictated them. <br><br>
When we compare Benjamin’s words with those of Nephi, we should consider how difficult it would have been for Joseph Smith to have done this. This constitutes significant evidence for the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

      <p>
King Benjamin taught his sons that, without the plates of brass, "we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the <b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:3), while having these plates allowed them to "read and understand his <b><i>mysteries" </i></b>(Mosiah 1:5). Earlier prophets also refer to the mysteries of God. Nephi spoke of "having had a great knowledge of the <b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> (1 Nephi 1:1), and his brother Jacob spoke of God’s "<b><i>mysteries"</i></b> (Jacob 4:8). Benjamin, however, specifically links a knowledge of the mysteries of God with the written word that he had in his possession. The prophet Alma, several generations later, spoke of mysteries contained on the plates of brass (Alma 37:4). Only Benjamin, however, uses the words "<b><i>mysteries of God"</i></b> in reference to the content on the plates of brass.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s teaching that a knowledge of the mysteries of God could be found on the brass plates, helps us to understand the value of the scriptures, which constitute a spiritual memory. They are a gateway to revelation and, without them, we are blind. Had they not been recorded, we would be unable to pass them down to future generations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder what mysteries we need to know in our own lives, diligently seek them, and strive to be worthy and ready to receive them.
