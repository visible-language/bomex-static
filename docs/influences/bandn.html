  <h1 class="content-title">The Influence of Nephi’s Words on King Benjamin’s Teachings to His Sons</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">The first chapter of Mosiah contains some of the teachings that King Benjamin taught his sons. Benjamin was the custodian of the plates that had been kept and preserved by his ancestors, including the small plates of Nephi (Omni 1:25). A comparison between Benjamin’s words in Mosiah 1 and those in 1 Nephi shows that the Nephite king was strongly influenced by his ancestor.</p>
<div class="analysis">
      <p>
      Nephi outlined various ways that the scriptures on the plates of brass would be a blessing to Lehi’s posterity. They would <br><br>
<ol>
<li>help in preserving the language of their fathers, </li>
<li>enable them to know the commandments of God so they could keep them,  </li>
<li>prevent them from dwindling in unbelief,  </li>
<li>enable them to know the mysteries of God, and  </li>
<li>enable them to know that the records were true.  </li>
</ol>
Benjamin’s counsel to his sons touches upon each of these points, as shown in the chart below.<br><br>
Key Insights <br><br>
The evidence for the influence of Nephi’s words upon Benjamin makes sense and is consistent with what the Book of Mormon states, because Benjamin had possession of those records. It is generally held by historians, however (both by believers and non-believers in the Book of Mormon account), that the book of Mosiah was dictated by Joseph Smith <b><i>before</i></b> 1 Nephi.<sup>1</sup>  Were the Book of Mormon a work of fiction by Joseph Smith, it would have been difficult for him to have remembered Nephi’s words before he dictated them. <br><br>
When we compare Benjamin’s words with those of Nephi, we should consider how difficult it would have been for Joseph Smith to have done this. This constitutes significant evidence for the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
