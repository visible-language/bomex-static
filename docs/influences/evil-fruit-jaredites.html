  <h1 class="content-title">The Evil Fruit of the Jaredites</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">In the story of the brother of Jared, Moroni uses language from the account of the Fall of Man to teach how man can be redeemed. He also draws upon this language to teach about the dangers and awful consequences of rejecting good knowledge revealed by God, and acting upon evil knowledge given by the devil. Moroni does this through the story of the daughter of unrighteous Jared, who introduced secret combinations to the Jaredites. Examples of this can be seen in &quot;Jared’s Daughter and the Serpent,&quot; &quot;The Evil Fruit of Unrestrained Ambition and Desire,&quot; &quot;Putting It into the Heart,&quot; &quot;That Which is Forbidden,&quot; &quot;Eyes Opened,&quot; and &quot;Enmity.&quot;</p>
<div class="analysis">
      <h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>By evoking the language found in Genesis and the Book of Moses, Moroni frames the introduction of evil knowledge and the practice of secret combinations as a second Fall in which the Jaredites bring death and destruction upon themselves by partaking of evil fruit. His account is a timely warning about the consequences of seeking evil, rather than seeking the knowledge of righteousness freely offered by God. By divine direction through His prophets, the Lord provides us with knowledge of how we can avoid the evil works of the devil and the conspiring designs of the wicked.
