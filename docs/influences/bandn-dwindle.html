When Nephi pondered whether or not he should slay Laban, the Spirit taught him, "It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should <b><i>dwindle</i></b> and perish <b><i>in unbelief"</i></b> (1 Nephi 4:13). Benjamin echoes these earlier words when he explains to his sons, "Were it not for these things . . . even our fathers would have <b><i>dwindled in unbelief,</i></b> and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things" (Mosiah 1:5). <br><br>
Key Insights <br><br>
Both Benjamin and Nephi recorded the tragic effects of scriptural illiteracy upon subsequent generations. As we read the teachings of King Benjamin, we should ask ourselves if we are doing all that we can to teach and perpetuate our scriptural heritage to the rising generation.
