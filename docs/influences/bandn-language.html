Nephi, in his efforts to persuade and encourage his brothers, said, "And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children, <b><i>the language of our fathers"</i></b> (1 Nephi 3:19). Benjamin taught his three sons, "For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to <b><i>his children,</i></b> except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in <b><i>the language of the Egyptians</i></b> therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to <b><i>his children,</i></b> that thereby they could teach them to <b><i>their children"</i></b> (Mosiah 1:4). Both prophets highlight the essential role the plates of brass played in preserving the language among their children. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Both Nephi and Benjamin emphasized how the scriptures helped to pass on an understanding of the language they were written in. Unlike Lehi and Benjamin’s children, most current readers of the Book of Mormon are not trained in the Egyptian language; however, the written words of the ancient prophets help us to become literate in the language of God’s ways. They can help those who receive and follow them understand and recognize the language of the Spirit of the Lord.  <br><br>
As we study the words of King Benjamin, we should ponder how these teachings can help us to become more responsive when the Spirit of the Lord speaks to us.
