  <h1 class="content-title">Ammon and Moses</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">In many ways, Ammon, the son of King Mosiah II, resembles the prophet Moses (See chart &quot;Ammon: A Prophet Like Moses&quot;). Both Ammon and Moses share notable characteristics. Both grew up as princes. Ammon was one of the sons of King Mosiah II and Moses was raised by the sister of Pharaoh in the royal court of Egypt. Both men, however, renounced their former royal privileges and become great servants of the Lord. Both men also had brothers named Aaron and both received a visitation from an angel of the Lord, whose message altered the course of their lives. Because of these similar life experiences, it is interesting to read the story of Ammon in light of the story of Moses.</p>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Ammon and Moses</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Ammon’s story shows him to be a prophet like Moses, when he helped to deliver the Lamanites from the bondage of sin, just as Moses delivered the Israelites from bondage to the Egyptians?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Moses fled from Egypt, Jethro "gave Moses Zipporah <b><i>his daughter"</i></b> to wife (Exodus 2:21). When Ammon first arrived in the land of Ishmael, King Lamoni offered to marry him to "one of <b><i>his daughters,"</i></b> although Ammon politely declined (Alma 17:24). The account in Exodus says that "Moses was content to <b><i>dwell with the man" Reuel or Jethro in Midian (Exodus 2:21). When Lamoni asked Ammon if he wanted to <b><i>dwell</i></b> in the land among his people, Ammon said, "Yea, I desire to <b><i>dwell</i></b> among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die" (Alma 17:23). <br><br>
While in Midian, "Moses kept the <b><i>flock</i></b> of Jethro his father-in-law" (Exodus 3:1). Similarly, Ammon was assigned to "watch the <b><i>flocks</i></b> of Lamoni" (Alma 17:25). On one occasion, when the daughters of Jethro were trying to draw water for the flocks of their father, a group of rival shepherds "came and drove them away: but Moses <b><i>stood</i></b> up and helped them and watered their flock" (Exodus 2:17). Similarly, when a gang of Lamanites attempted to scatter the king’s flocks, Ammon "<b><i>stood</i></b> to contend with" them and defended and preserved the flocks at the watering place (Alma 17:34). When Jethro’s daughters reported to their father what Moses had done to help them, he asked, "<b><i>Where is he?"</i></b> (Exodus 2:20). Similarly, when Lamoni’s servants reported how Ammon had successfully defended the king’s flocks, he asked, "<b><i>Where is this man?"</i></b> (Alma 17:8). <br><br>
Later, the Lord spoke to Moses and told him that He had seen and heard the afflictions of His people who were in bondage and called him to go down into Egypt so that the Lord could "<b><i>deliver</i></b> them out of the hands of Egyptians" (Exodus 3:7-8, 10). When Moses learned this, he spoke to Jethro and told him that that he would return to Egypt to do so (Exodus 4:18). The Lord also spoke to Ammon and told him that his brethren were in prison in the land of Middoni (Alma 20:2) and sent him to "<b><i>deliver"</i></b> them (Alma 20:5). Ammon then told Lamoni what the Lord had said (Alma 20:3-5).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>When Mormon recounts the story of Ammon, he recounts shared parts of the Ammon and Exodus stories and highlights key words that point to reader to similarities in both prophets. He does this to emphasize how God used both Moses and Ammon to deliver His people. Ammon is likened to Moses because, like that earlier prophet, he and his brother Aaron and their companions were the Lord’s servants in delivering thousands of the Lamanites from the bondage of sin through the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This remarkable account of Lamanite conversions is a continuing fulfillment of the Lord’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would always remember his people and visit them in mercy from generation to generation. He will do the same for us today.
