  <h1 class="content-title">The Redemption of the Brother of Jared</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">At the commencement of his abridgement of the Jaredite record, Moroni explains that, while that record contained an account from the time of Adam down to the story of the tower, he omitted that material from his abridgement because he knew that we would have a similar account in our scriptures (Ether 1:3-4). However, Moroni does make use of and allude to the account of the Fall of Adam that was on both the plates of brass and Ether’s plates. The following cameos, &quot;Shut Out From the Lord’s Presence,&quot; &quot;Calling Upon the Name of the Lord,&quot; &quot;Returning to the Tree,&quot; &quot;Good Knowledge from the Tree,&quot; and the accompanying chart, &quot;A Reversal of the Fall,&quot; show how Moroni uses words from the story of Adam and Eve in his account of the Brother of Jared to teach us how we can find redemption and enduring happiness through Jesus Christ.</p>

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Calling Upon the Name of the Lord</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that the practice of calling upon the name of the Lord includes the principle of sincere repentance?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
One insight about the Fall of Man is not found in Genesis, but was restored in the book of Moses. After they were driven out of the garden, Adam and Eve called upon the name of the Lord in prayer. "And Adam and Eve, his wife, <b><i>called upon the name of the Lord"</i></b> (Moses 5:4). God sent an angel commanding them, "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and <b><i>call upon God in the name of the Son</i></b> forevermore" (Moses 5:8). It is clear that Adam and Eve were obedient and followed this pattern of prayer, which included the principle of repentance, throughout their lives. "And Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to <b><i>call upon God"</i></b> (Moses 5:16). <br><br>
When he and his people were driven out of their homeland, the brother of Jared had already established a pattern of crying unto God for blessings and counsel (Ether 1:34-39, 43). At one point, however, the brother of Jared became neglectful of this commandment and was reproved for it. As the Lord stood in the cloud, He chastened the brother of Jared "because he remembered not to <b><i>call upon the name of the Lord.</i></b> And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did <b><i>call upon the name of the Lord</i></b> for his brethren who were with him" (Ether 2:14-15). It is clear that this practice of calling upon the name of the Lord included the principle of repentance, as it had been taught long before in the time of Adam and Eve. As he faithfully continued this pattern, the brother of Jared was greatly blessed. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights </b><br><br>
As Moroni describes, the brother of Jared followed the pattern revealed and taught to Adam and Eve of repenting and calling upon the name of the Lord. Even though the Jaredites were not yet prepared to enter the presence of God, the principle of righteous prayer helped them continue in the covenant path and receive the guidance and blessings that they needed in their journey.  <br><br>
As we read the account of the brother of Jared and his people, we should ponder how much we truly need to repent and call upon our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As it was with the brother of Jared and his people, this can be a source of comfort and power that will help us more fully appreciate how the Lord loves us and helps us, as we face the challenges in our lives.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Enmity</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that the story of Jared and Akish teaches how evil thinking and evil deeds breed enmity, strife, and misery in people and families?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In Genesis, after Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, the Lord said, "And I will put <b><i>enmity</i></b> between <b><i>thee</i></b> and the woman, and between <b><i>thy seed</i></b> and <b><i>her seed;</i></b> it shall <b><i>bruise thy head,</i></b> and thou shalt bruise his heel" (Genesis 3:15). Moroni’s account of Jared, his daughter, Akish, and his children draws upon the background of the Lord’s prophecy to Adam and Eve in the biblical story. <br><br>
In Ether, after Jared and his daughter introduced secret combinations, enmity abounded. Shortly after Jared obtained the kingdom, Akish "applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they obtained the <b>head</b> of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people" (Ether 9:5). After killing his father-in-law, "Akish began to be jealous of his son" and killed him (Ether 9:7). There followed a civil war between Akish and his other sons (Ether 9:10) until everyone in the kingdom was dead, except for a few (Ether 9:12). Moroni’s account shows that the adoption of evil practices did not lead to happiness for the Jaredites, but produced greater enmity, family strife, and eventual destruction. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By drawing upon the words spoken by the Lord to Adam and Eve, Moroni shows how evil, when allowed to spread, breeds enmity, jealousy, and division in people, families, and nations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how the gospel of Jesus Christ can help us to act in ways that eliminate evil and other sources of contention from our lives.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Eyes Opened</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni uses language from the story of Adam and Eve to open our eyes and give us a knowledge of evil, so we can be wise and not deceived by it?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In the scriptural account of the Fall, we learn that by partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the eyes of the man and the woman were opened. "For God doth know that in the day that ye eat thereof, then your <b><i>eyes shall be opened,</i></b> and ye shall <b><i>be as the gods, knowing good and evil."</i></b> The tree was "to be desired to make one <b><i>wise,"</i></b> and after they partook, "the <b><i>eyes</i></b> of them both were <b><i>opened"</i></b> (Genesis 3:6-7). <br><br>
After describing the Satanic introduction of secret combinations among the Jaredites, Moroni warns the latter-day reader of the Book of Mormon: "Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is <b><i>wisdom</i></b> in God that these things should be <b><i>shown</i></b> unto you" (Ether 8:23). Moroni’s words show that he wants to <b><i>open </i>our<i> eyes</i></b> and give <i>us</i> a <b><i>knowledge of evil</i></b> combinations so that we can be aware of them and protect ourselves against their dangers. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Moroni uses words that remind us of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and its qualities to show us how to be wise. God-given wisdom, provided through the Book of Mormon in our day, alerts us beforehand to the dangers these evils pose to families, societies, and nations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how revelation from God through the Book of Mormon and latter-day prophets, seers, and revelators can help us to become aware of and avoid contemporary dangers.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Good Knowledge From the Tree</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that the Brother of Jared’s story shows how faith in our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, can bring us greater knowledge that can increase our happiness and blessings in this life?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Consider the language related to knowledge used by the Lord and Moroni in the story of the Brother of Jared. In Ether, divinely given knowledge brings salvation, rather than death. Previous to his remarkable vision, Jared’s brother "<b><i><b><i>knew</i></b> not" that the Lord had a body (Ether 3:8). Later, the Lord says, "Because thou <b><i>knowest</i></b> these things ye are redeemed from the fall" (Ether 3:13). Where previously, partaking of the fruit resulted in man’s fall, expulsion, and death, receiving the true knowledge of God through faith resulted in his redemption. That knowledge was given "that this man might <b><i>know</i></b> that he was God" (Ether 3:18). "And because of the <b><i>knowledge</i></b> of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil . . .  for he <b><i>knew, nothing doubting" (Ether 3:19). He had "this perfect <b><i>knowledge</i></b> of God" (Ether 3:20), and "he <b><i>knew</i></b> that the Lord could show him all things" (Ether 3:26). <br><br>
Moroni also reminds us that those who believe these things will also receive the Spirit, and "shall <b><i>know</i></b> and bear record. For because of my Spirit, he shall <b><i>know</i></b> that these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do <b><i>good.</i></b> And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do <b><i>good</i></b> is of me; for <b><i>good</i></b> cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all <b><i>good"</i></b> (Ether 4:11-12).  <br><br>
The Lord also invites us, the readers of this account, to come unto Him, so that He can show us "the <b><i>knowledge</i></b> which is hid up because of unbelief" (Ether 4:13). He invites us all, like the Brother of Jared, to rend the veil of unbelief that causes us to remain in in a state of blindness. The Lord wants us to open our eyes, and when they are, "then shall [we] <b><i>know"</i></b> (Ether 4:15-17). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
The Lord will provide knowledge to the faithful and obedient, but, as Moroni’s account of the Brother of Jared shows, it must be sought, and can only be found in the Lord’s way. The Brother of Jared obtained knowledge through persistent faith, repentance, obedience, and prayer. Having proven to the Lord that he was willing to follow this righteous pattern, the Lord blessed him with great knowledge.  <br><br>
Moroni frames these blessings of knowledge in language from the Fall of Man, in which a knowledge of good things is not taken by man, but generously provided by the Lord, once a person has shown they are capable, willing, and worthy to receive it. As we read the story of Jared’s brother, we should ponder how we can wisely use the knowledge of good that the Lord provides to bless the lives of others.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jaredite Destruction and the Flood</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni uses language of the Flood story to characterize the destruction of the Jaredites?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In the final section of his account of the Jaredites, Moroni again points the reader to the subject of the Flood, which was a curse upon the wicked during the days of Noah. "For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the <b><i>waters</i></b> had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands" (Ether 13:2). The recession of the waters after the Flood was a blessing to Noah and his descendants, just as the Flood had been a curse. The rejection of the Jaredite prophet Ether indicates a return of the curse. <br><br>
Moroni then traces the final battles between Coriantumr, the last Jaredite king, and his enemies. Before the Flood, there were "<b><i>mighty men</i></b> . . . of old, men of renown" (Genesis 6:4). Three times, Moroni refers to "<b><i>mighty men"</i></b> in the final Jaredite war (Ether 13:15; 15:2, 26). The Genesis account states that the "waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth" and that all was "<b><i>covered"</i></b> (Genesis 7:19-20). Moroni evokes the Flood story in his description of the Jaredite destruction; but in this case, rather than water, "the whole face of the land was <b><i>covered</i></b> with the bodies of the dead" (Ether 14:21). <br><br>
The Lord had warned Noah, "<b><i>my Spirit shall not always strive with man"</i></b> (Genesis 6:3), and had warned the brother of Jared to "remember that <b><i>my Spirit will not always strive with man" </i></b>(Ether 2:15). Moroni writes concerning the Jaredites: "But behold, <b><i>the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them,</i></b> and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed" (Ether 15:19). <br><br>
The account in Genesis states that all but Noah and his family were destroyed in the Flood. "<b><i>And every living substance was destroyed</i></b> which was upon the face of the ground ... and they were <b><i>destroyed</i></b> from the earth; and <b><i>Noah only remained alive,</i></b> and they that were with him in the ark" (Genesis 7:23). In an ironic reversal of the Noah comparison, Coriantumr is cursed to be like Noah---a witness of total destruction. Ether prophesied that if he and his household would repent, they would be spared; "otherwise they should be <b><i>destroyed,</i></b> and all his household <b><i>save it were himself</i></b>.... And <b><i>every living soul should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr"</i></b> (Ether 13:21). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Moroni’s selection of language shows that the story of Noah and the Flood lies behind much of his description of the Jaredite destruction. This helps the reader to more fully appreciate Moroni’s message and purpose, which is to persuade the reader to believe in Christ and repent to avoid similar destruction. As we study the account of the destruction of the Jaredites, we should ponder how the teachings and doctrine of Christ can lead us on a secure path that will bring us greater happiness.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jared’s Daughter and the Serpent</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni describes Jared’s daughter in terms similar to the serpent in the story of the Fall?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The account of the Garden in Genesis states that "<b><i>the serpent</i></b> was <b><i>more subtle</i></b> than any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had made" (Genesis 3:1). The word that the King James translation renders as "subtle" more accurately means "crafty" or "cunning," as reflected in more recent translations, such as the New Revised Standard Version. <br><br>
Moroni, in his account of the Jaredites, says that the daughter of Jared was "exceedingly expert" (Ether 8:8). The word "expert" has the connotation of being skilled, clever, experienced, and knowing how to get things done. The wording invites the reader to compare the daughter of Jared to the serpent who enticed Eve to partake of the forbidden fruit, bringing death into the world. In Moroni’s account, Jared’s wicked daughter is the agent who introduces a deadly evil into Jaredite society. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Jared’s daughter inspired her wicked father to form a murderous secret combination to overthrow the kingdom of his father Omer. Moroni’s use of the words "exceedingly expert" suggests that she was knowledgeable and clever; but she used these skills to introduce an evil plan among the people. Moroni’s account shows how skills and cleverness without righteousness can be used in ways that lead to misery and awful consequences within families and society. As we read this account, we should ponder how we can use the talents and abilities the Lord has given us for good and not evil purposes.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Putting It Into the Heart</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni’s use of the phrase &quot;put it into his heart&quot; ties the actions of Jared and his daughter to the devil, who from the beginning, sought to deceive and lead to destruction all those who would listen to him?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The account of the Fall of Man in the Book of Moses provides additional words that are not found in the Genesis story. The Moses account states, "And Satan <b><i>put it into the heart</i></b> of the serpent, (for he had drawn away many after him,) ... for he knew not the mind of God, wherefore he sought to <b><i>destroy the world"</i></b> (Moses 4:6). Although the plan of our Heavenly Father prepared a way for our redemption from transgression, the Moses account explains that the goal of the devil in bringing a knowledge of evil into the world was to destroy man by causing him to rebel against God and His commandments. <br><br>
In his account in the book of Ether, Moroni explains how secret combinations were introduced among the Jaredites. He states that, "It was the daughter of Jared who <b><i>put it into his heart</i></b> to search up these things of old; and Jared <b><i>put it into the heart</i></b> of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired" (Ether 8:17). The Moses account shows a transmission from Satan to the serpent, and from the serpent to Eve and Adam---leading to transgression and death. <br><br>
In Ether, evil knowledge is transmitted from Jared’s daughter to her father, and then to Akish, who brings the evil and murderous plan to fruition. Notably, as with the event in the garden, this leads to the death of Jared, and Akish, and their kingdom (Ether 8:21; 9:12). This great destruction was brought about when this series of individuals allowed evil to be put into their hearts. In contrast to the followers of Akish, the righteous King Omer and those who followed him were protected and preserved from the wicked plans of their enemies.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Moroni’s words tie the Ether story to the Fall of Man to emphasize the dangers of allowing evil things to enter and remain in one’s heart. By refusing to allow such things to remain and have place in our hearts and minds, we can avoid what happened to the Jaredites. As we read the account in Ether, we should ponder how the gospel of Jesus Christ and its sacred covenants can strengthen and protect us from agents of the adversary, who strive to put things into our hearts that can destroy our peace and happiness. We can then live the gospel and keep the covenants to access that strength and protection.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Returning to the Tree</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni frames the account of the Brother of Jared’s vision of Jesus as a reversal of Adam and Eve’s transgression by partaking of the fruit?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The revelation of the Lord touching with His finger the stones presented by the Brother of Jared (Ether 3:6) is presented by Moroni as a reversal of the Fall by partaking of the forbidden fruit. Adam was commanded not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 2:17): "neither shall ye <b><i>touch</i></b> it, lest ye die" (Genesis 3:3). Contrary to this commandment, the man "<b><i>put forth</i></b> his hand" (Genesis 3:22) and partook, resulting in death and mankind being cut off from God’s presence. <br><br>
In Ether, however, the Brother of Jared did not put forth his hand, but humbly asked the Lord to do so by touching the stones he had prepared to give them light. Moroni then says that "the Lord <b><i>stretched forth</i></b> his hand and <b><i>touched</i></b> the stones one by one with his finger" to provide light for the man and his people (Ether 3:6). In contrast to Genesis, the man did not attempt to usurp knowledge for himself in violation of a commandment, but asked <b><i>the Lord</i></b> to touch what he had prepared and offered in faith and humility. Adam’s eyes were opened after he partook of the forbidden fruit, just as the veil was taken from off the eyes of the Brother of Jared, allowing him to see the finger of the Lord. <br><br>
When man fell, he was afraid and <b><i>hid</i></b> himself because of his nakedness before God. When the Brother of Jared saw the finger of the Lord unveiled before his eyes, he too was afraid and "fell" to the ground. Having exercised patience and faith, with his eyes now opened, and at the Lord’s initiative, the man was shown all things and commanded to write them down and then <b><i>hide</i></b> them up. <br><br>
The forbidden fruit of the tree could make one <b><i>wise</i></b> (Genesis 3:6). The Lord commanded that the things Jared’s brother had seen and written should be <b><i>hidden up</i></b> and sealed. Joseph Smith was commanded to "<b><i>touch them not;</i></b> ... for that thing," like the fruit of the tree of knowledge, "is forbidden you, except’ it shall be <b><i>wisdom</i></b> in God" (Ether 5:1). As partaking of the fruit brought death and caused man to be cast out of God’s presence, the Lord’s response to another man’s faith gave him knowledge and brought him back into His presence for eventual eternal life (Ether 3:14).<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Moroni’s use of language from the Fall of Adam and Eve helps to underscore how we, as fallen creatures in a mortal world, can be redeemed through faith in Jesus Christ, and how we can approach God and be recognized and blessed. Just as the Brother of Jared was joyfully surprised by what he learned, we too can be blessed and rejoice as we follow the pattern provided in Moroni’s account. <br><br>
As we read the Brother of Jared’s story, we should ponder how a knowledge of Jesus Christ and His gospel can open our eyes to the joys made possible through our Heavenly Father’s plan. Humility, patience, and faithful diligence before the Lord will open the windows of heaven to greater happiness.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Secret Combinations and the Flood</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni characterizes the introduction of secret combinations among the Jaredites as a destructive flood of wickedness?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
      In the Genesis story, before the Flood, the <b><i>sons</i></b> of God "saw the daughters of men that they were <b><i>fair;</i></b></i></b> and they took them <b><i>wives</i></b> of all whom they chose" (Genesis: 6:2). In the book of Ether, it is not a man, but the cunning daughter of wicked Jared, who introduces the idea of a murderous conspiracy to obtain power. The daughter of Jared said to her father, "And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the <b><i>son </i></b>of Kimnor; and behold, I am <b><i>fair,</i></b> and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to <b><i>wife"</i></b> (Ether 8:10). <br><br>
Once the kingdom is overthrown, Akish uses the same tool of secret combinations to murder his father-in-law, Jared. "For so <b><i>great</i></b> had been the spreading of this <b><i>wicked</i></b> and secret society, that it had <b><i>corrupted </i></b>the hearts of all the people" (Ether 9:6). After the Flood, the Lord gave Noah commandments against the shedding of blood. "And whoso <b><i>sheddeth man’s blood,</i></b> by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man" (Genesis 9:6). After he describes the conspiracy of Jared and Akish, Moroni reminds the reader that "the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that <b><i>man should shed blood,</i></b> but in all things hath forbidden it from the beginning of man" (Ether 8:19).  <br><br>
In the Genesis story, "God saw that the <b><i>wickedness</i></b> of man was <b><i>great"</i></b> (Genesis 6:5), "the earth was <b><i>corrupt</i></b> before God," and "the earth was filled with violence. And God looked upon the earth, and behold, it was <b><i>corrupt;</i></b> for all flesh had <b><i>corrupted</i></b> his way upon the earth" (Genesis 6:11-12). In the Genesis story, the daughters of men give birth to mighty men who lead society into a cycle of wickedness and violence (Genesis 6:4-5, 13). In Ether, the sons of Akish engage in a bloody civil war with their father (Ether 9:12). <br><br>
Notably, King Omer and his righteous family and followers, like Noah and his family, were preserved and protected by God during all of this wickedness and destruction. The Genesis account says the wicked at the time of the Flood "were <b><i>destroyed</i></b> from the earth; and <b><i>Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him</i></b> in the ark" (Genesis 6:23). The civil war between Akish and his sons resulted in "the <b><i>destruction</i></b> of nearly all the people of the kingdom, yea, even <b><i>all, save it were for thirty souls, and they who fled with the house of Omer"</i></b> (Ether 9:12-13). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By using language from the Flood narrative, Moroni highlights the destructive nature of secret and murderous combinations. Just as the gross wickedness and violence of the people led to destruction at the time of the Flood, the introduction of secret combinations by Jared, his daughter, and Akish led to the almost total destruction of the kingdom in Omer’s day. As we read the book of Ether, we should note that we too live in a time when there is a flood of violence and wickedness. The Book of Mormon can teach us how the words of Christ can preserve us and carry us through.

<sup>1</sup>  When Cain killed his brother Abel, the Lord told him that "the voice of thy brother’s <b><i>blood crieth</i></b> unto me <b><i>from the ground"</i></b> (Genesis 4:10). Speaking of secret combinations, Moroni states "that the <b><i>blood</i></b> of [the Lord’s] saints, which shall be shed by them," shall "<b><i>cry</i></b> unto him <b><i>from the ground"</i></b> (Ether 8:22).

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Shut Out From the Lord’s Presence</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that the departure of the Jaredites from the land of the great tower into the wilderness, in Moroni’s account, is like being cast out of the Garden of Eden?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In his account of the Brother of Jared and his people, Moroni uses language from the story of the Fall of Man found in Genesis and the restored account in the book of Moses. The Genesis account of the Fall says that, following Adam’s transgression, the Lord "<b><i>drove out</i></b> the man" (Genesis 3:24). After he murdered his brother Abel, Cain also remarked that God had "<b><i>driven me out"</i></b> (Genesis 4:14). Jared asks his brother to "go and inquire of the Lord whether he will <b><i>drive us out</i></b> of the land, and if he will <b><i>drive us out</i></b> of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go" (Ether 1:38). Later, the Brother of Jared notes that the Lord had "<b><i>driven us forth"</i></b> (Ether 2:15). The departure from the land of the great tower into the wilderness is like being driven out of the Garden of Eden into the painful and difficult world. <br><br>
Other words in the account highlight the separation between the Jaredites and God during their journey. After they transgressed, Adam and Eve are said to have "hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God" (Genesis 3:8). Cain is likewise described as being separated from "the presence of the Lord" (Genesis 4:16). This separation is amplified in the book of Moses where, after they had been driven out of the garden, the Lord did not converse with man face to face as He had before. "And they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they <b><i>saw him not;</i></b> for they were shut out from his presence" (Moses 5:4).  <br><br>
Moroni describes the Brother of Jared’s encounters with the Lord during their wilderness journey using similar wording. Moroni wrote, "The Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared <b><i>saw him not"</i></b> (Ether 2:4). Later, as they continued their journey, the Lord "did talk with them as he stood in a cloud" (Ether 2:5). After being driven out of the land of their origin (Ether 1:38; 3:3), the Jaredites are represented as being like Adam and Eve after being driven out of the garden, who only heard the Lord’s voice giving them commandments. It is also interesting that Moroni’s wording "saw him not" does not come from the Genesis account, but from the account in the book of Moses, which was restored by Joseph Smith.  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By using language from the account of the Fall of Man, Moroni sets up the story of the Brother of Jared as a story that shows the pattern of redemption through faith in Jesus Christ. As we read the account in the book of Ether, we should ponder the many ways that the Lord was merciful to the Jaredites during their difficult journey. We should also ponder the many ways the Lord is kind and merciful to us, as we travel through an often dark and dreary world.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>That Which is Forbidden</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni cites words from the Lord’s commandment to Adam and Eve to warn against the temptation and dangers of secret combinations?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In the Moses account of the Fall of Man, the Lord commanded Adam and Eve, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but remember that I <b><i>forbid it"</i></b> (Moses 3:17). The last phrase does not appear in the Genesis version; however, Moroni does reference it in his warning about the dangers of secret combinations. Moroni says, "For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath <b><i>forbidden it</i></b> from the beginning of man" (Ether 8:19). Secrets combinations and all the evils associated with them are forbidden, just as the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was forbidden to man in the beginning. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
God forbade man to partake of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; but Adam and Eve partook, an act that introduced them to death. In mortality, we encounter both good and evil in our lives. The story of the Jaredites teaches the dangers of secret combinations, which are promoted by the adversary to those who hearken to him. It often takes faith or trust in God to choose to act in righteousness, rather than follow the devil. As we read the Book of Ether, we should ponder how we can develop greater trust in our Redeemer and strength to stand for and share what is good.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>The Brother of Jared and Noah</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni uses language from the Flood story that portrays the Brother of Jared as a Noah figure?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
      In the Flood story, Noah is described as a righteous man who lived in very wicked times, yet "found <b><i>grace</i></b> in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8). The Brother of Jared also lived in a time of wickedness and was "a man highly <b><i>favored</i></b> of the Lord" (Ether 1:34). Biblical scholar E. A. Speiser observed that the Hebrew word sometimes rendered as "found grace" in the Genesis passage literally means "won <b><i>favor,"</i></b> rather than grace.<sup>1</sup>  The comparison between the Brother of Jared and Noah is strengthened by the reference to the Jaredite prophet being highly <b><i>favored.</i></b> <br><br>
In the Genesis account, Noah has wicked contemporaries who are described as "<b><i>mighty men"</i></b> (Genesis 6:4). The Brother Jared is described as a "<b><i>mighty man"</i></b> (Ether 1:34), but one who is righteous. Noah’s ark was to be provisioned with "<b><i>all food</i></b> that is eaten" and carried animals that included "<b><i>fowls</i></b> after their kind" (Genesis 6:21). Similarly, the Brother of Jared "prepared <b><i>all manner of food</i></b>" for himself and his family, as well as for the animals including "<b><i>fowl</i></b> that they should carry with them" (Ether 6:4). <br><br>
Before they were destroyed by the Flood, the people were grossly wicked and "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only <b><i>evil continually"</i></b> (Genesis 6:5). When the Brother of Jared confessed to the Lord, he said that "because of the fall our natures have become <b><i>evil continually"</i></b> (Ether 3:2). The Lord in Noah’s day said, "<b><i>My Spirit will not always strive with man"</i></b> (Genesis 6:3). He admonished the Brother of Jared to "remember that <b><i>my Spirit will not always strive with man"</i></b> (Ether 2:15). The language selected and used by Moroni suggests that when we read and study the book of Ether, we should keep in mind the story of Noah and the Flood.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Both the Brother of Jared and Noah lived in a time of wickedness, but were greatly favored by God with covenant blessings, which had a profound effect upon themselves and their families. As we study the book of Ether, we should note examples of these blessings in their history, and ponder ways that we can also lay hold upon covenant blessings that the Lord has made available to us.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>The Evil Fruit of Unrestrained Ambition and Desire</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Moroni uses words from the story of the forbidden fruit to warn of the dangers of unrestrained passions and desires?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In Genesis, when the woman saw that the tree of knowledge of good and evil "<i>was <b>pleasant</b> to the eyes, and a tree to be <b>desired</b> to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat" </i> (Genesis 3:6). In the Ether story, Jared’s daughter introduces her plan as follows:<br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will <b>please</b> him, that he will <b>desire</b> me to wife; wherefore if he shall <b>desire</b> of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king. . . .  <br><br>
When Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she <b>pleased</b> him, insomuch that he <b>desired</b> her to wife </i>(Ether 8:10-11).</p><br><br>
The evil plan described in Ether evokes words that echo Eve’s desire for the fruit of the tree in the story of the Fall. However, in this case, the plan of Jared’s daughter sets up another fall, and by implication, death and destruction for Jared, Akish, and their people, through the introduction of secret combinations to murder and gain power. The evil of unrestrained desire is shown in the case of Akish, whose desire for Jared’s daughter leads him to betray any integrity he once had and attempt the murder of Omer, who "was a friend to Akish" (Ether 8:11).<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
In Genesis, the words "pleasant" and "desired" are connected with the temptation of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, of which Eve partook and gave to her husband, resulting in the death of mankind. Moroni uses similar words to describe the introduction of secret combinations among the Jaredites. In this case, another woman, Jared’s daughter, conspires with her father to cause another man, her future husband Akish, to use evil knowledge in a wicked, murderous plan, which would result in the death and destruction of most of that people. <br><br>
As we read the story of the plot of Akish and Jared’s family, we should ponder how the principles and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ can help us to control our passions and desires, providing safety in our lives.

      <p>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
By evoking the language found in Genesis and the Book of Moses, Moroni frames the introduction of evil knowledge and the practice of secret combinations as a second Fall in which the Jaredites bring death and destruction upon themselves by partaking of evil fruit. His account is a timely warning about the consequences of seeking evil, rather than seeking the knowledge of righteousness freely offered by God. By divine direction through His prophets, the Lord provides us with knowledge of how we can avoid the evil works of the devil and the conspiring designs of the wicked.

One of the ways that the writings of prophets help us is to draw our attention to other stories from the scriptures, which support, strengthen, and encourage us to act with faith and do what those prophets teach that we should do. One example of this can be found in Moroni’s abridgment of the record of Ether. Moroni’s selection of words in this account of the Jaredites points the reader to similar language in the story of the Flood. Evidence for this can be seen in the following examples, which include <i>The Brother of Jared and Noah, Secret Combinations and the Flood,</i> and <i>Jaredite Destruction and the Flood.</i> <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Noah was a righteous man whom God blessed with sacred covenants. These covenant blessings helped him to preserve his family in difficult times, and escape the corrosive and deadly flood of wickedness that surrounded them. Similar influences and agencies surround us today. Moroni helps us to see ourselves in the story of the Jaredites and ponder how we can do better and be happier. As we read the book of Ether, we should ponder what we can do to increase the covenant blessings in our lives.
