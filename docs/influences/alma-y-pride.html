<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Alma and Lehi’s Words about the Plan of Happiness</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Lehi’s counsel on the plates of Nephi about the divine plan of happiness was helpful to Alma II as he counseled his son Corianton?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Alma taught his son Corianton about the plan of happiness, he drew upon the earlier words of father Lehi. Alma taught that repentance could not come unto men unless there was "a <b><i>punishment,</i></b which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, <b><i>affixed opposite</i></b to the plan of <b><i>happiness,</i></b which was as eternal also as the life of the soul" (Alma 42:16). Similarly, Lehi had said that the "<b><i>punishment</i></b that is <b><i>affixed is in opposition</i></b to that of the <b><i>happiness</i></b which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement" (2 Nephi 2:10). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
The teachings of Lehi recorded on the plates of Nephi were a blessing to Alma as he counseled his confused and troubled son. When we read Alma’s words, we should ponder how his words and those of other Book of Mormon prophets can help us to provide wise and needed counsel to our children and others who need it.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Alma and Nephi’s Teachings about the Plates and the Liahona</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Alma II drew upon Nephi’s teachings about the plates and the Liahona to explain important gospel principles to his son Helaman?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Alma taught his son Helaman that God commanded the small plates of Nephi to be kept “for a wise purpose in him” (Alma 37:14, 18), which is the precise phrase used by Nephi (1 Nephi 9:5; 19:3). Alma also refers to the “plates of brass,” which contain “the genealogy of our forefathers” (Alma 37:3; 1 Nephi 5:14, 16), and references Lehi’s prophecy that those plates would eventually “go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people” (Alma 37:4; 1 Nephi 5:17–18). Alma also admonishes his son that he must care for the plates so that they may “retain their brightness” (Alma 37:5). Lehi had prophesied that the plates of brass would not “be dimmed any more by time” (1 Nephi 5:19). <br><br>
Alma refers to the Liahona as a “ball” and as a “compass” that was “prepared” by the Lord (Alma 37:38), just as Nephi does (2 Nephi 5:12). Both prophets speak of its “curious workmanship” (Alma 37:39; 1 Nephi 16:10) and that it worked “according to their faith” (Alma 37:40; 1 Nephi 16:28), but that it “ceased” to work without faith (Alma 37:41; 1 Nephi 18:12–13). They added that through “small means” the Lord showed great things (Alma 37:41; 1 Nephi 16:29). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Alma’s teachings show that he was very familiar with the teachings of Nephi on the small plates, and they greatly influenced what he taught his son. When we read the words of Alma to Helaman, we should remember that the Lord fulfills His promises to His people, including us. We should always seek to exercise faith in Christ to qualify to receive His blessings. The Lord can use our weak and seemingly small acts of faith to fulfill His divine purposes and to bless our lives and the lives of others.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Alma and the Words of Jacob on the Dangers of Pride and Riches</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Alma II drew upon the teachings of Jacob in the plates of Nephi to warn the Nephites in Zarahemla of the dangers of riches and pride?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Shortly before the death of King Mosiah II, Alma II was entrusted with all the records of the Nephites previously kept by the Nephite kings (Mosiah 28:20). King Mosiah “took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem” (Mosiah 28:20). <br><br>
A comparison of Alma’s teachings with those on the plates of Nephi show that he frequently drew upon the words of his prophetic ancestors. Examples of the influence of the plates of Nephi on Alma’s teachings can be found in his warnings about the dangers of pride and riches, allusions to Lehi’s visions, Nephi’s teachings about the plates and the Liahona, and the plan of happiness. <br><br>
Alma spoke of the dangers of pride and riches to the people of Zarahemla. His teachings and words on this subject are similar to those of Jacob the brother of Nephi on the small plates. In both passages, the prophets are concerned with the negative impact of wealth and prosperity upon the people of Nephi. Both Jacob and Alma speak of riches and the costly apparel of the people. Each condemns the pride of the hearts of the people, in which they suppose that they are better than their brethren, and which leads to persecution (Alma 5:53–54; Jacob 2:13).  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Alma’s words about riches provide a good caution for our day. When we read Alma’s teachings, we should ponder how we can be more fully humble before God and our fellow man, and always treat others as we would like to be treated. Also, Alma drew upon the scriptures in his possession to deal with serious challenges in his life and to know what to teach. We can likewise be blessed as we search the scriptures to find answers and help in dealing with our own challenges.  <br><br>
An additional insight drawn from Alma’s use of these and other teachings from the plates of Nephi may not initially be obvious to the reader. It is generally accepted now that our current text of the Book of Mormon was dictated from Mosiah through 4 Nephi following the loss of the 116 pages of the book of Lehi. This means that Alma’s teachings in this portion of the Book of Mormon were actually dictated by Joseph Smith <b><i>before</i></b> the source material on the small plates (1 Nephi through Omni).  <br><br>
It would, of course, be very difficult for Joseph Smith to remember and keep such details straight, had he been the author of the Book of Mormon. However, Alma’s use of this source material on the small plates is consistent with what the Book of Mormon says (he had the small plates in his possession) and is exactly what one would expect if the Book of Mormon was true.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Alma’s Counsel to His Son and the Words of Abinadi</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Alma II used the teachings of Abinadi to counsel his son, Corianton?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
      Alma’s father, Alma I, had been one of King Noah’s priests at the time when Abinadi was brought before King Noah’s court. He was converted by Abinadi’s words and recorded Abinadi’s teachings and testimony (Mosiah 17:2; 18:1-3). When we examine the teachings of Alma II, we find evidence that he drew upon this record when counseling his troubled son, Corianton.<sup>1</sup>  <br><br>
While some of the words and phrases from Abinadi’s sermons can also be found in the writings of subsequent Book of Mormon speakers, others are only found in the writings of Alma. These include the warning that unless he repented, his sins would "stand as a testimony against [him] at the last day" (Mosiah 16:10; Alma 39:8), the phrase "they have no part" (Mosiah 15:26; Alma 40:13), the teaching that all will be "brought to stand before God" to be "judged . . . according to their works" (Mosiah 16:10; Alma 40:21), and a reference to a "first resurrection" (Mosiah 15:21; Alma 40:15-17). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Alma’s words show how the prophetic teachings of Abinadi, treasured and faithfully recorded by his father, became a blessing leading to the repentance of his son Corianton, and continues to bless readers today. When we read the words of Alma to Corianton, we should ponder how those teachings can help us to have greater faith in Christ, and build greater faith in the hearts of our families.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Alma’s Words and Lehi’s Visions</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Alma II’s words reflect the accounts of the visions of his ancestor Lehi?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Alma recounts his dramatic conversion to his son Helaman, he evokes the words of his ancestor Lehi’s visionary experience. Alma says, "Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, <b><i>God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God;</i></b> yea, and my soul did long to be there" (Alma 36:22). Alma specifically mentions Lehi’s experience, and his words precisely match those found in 1 Nephi 1:8. <br><br>
When Alma speaks of his post-conversion desire to diligently share the gospel message, he draws upon the language of Lehi’s vision of the tree of life. "I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to <b><i>taste</i></b> of the <b><i>exceeding joy</i></b> of which I did <b><i>taste"</i></b> (Alma 36:24). Alma’s words evoke Lehi’s description: "And as I <b><i>partook</i></b> of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with <b><i>exceeding great joy;</i></b> wherefore I began to be desirous that my family should <b><i>partake</i></b> of it also" (1 Nephi 8:12). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Alma’s words show a familiarity with Lehi’s teachings and indicate that he pondered the scriptures of his prophetic ancestor. When we read Alma’s words to his son Helaman, we should ponder how we can seek to see and hear and know what Alma experienced, which brought such exquisite joy into his life.
