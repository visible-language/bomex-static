<div class="analysis">
      <p>
Shortly before the death of King Mosiah II, Alma II was entrusted with all the records of the Nephites previously kept by the Nephite kings (Mosiah 28:20). King Mosiah “took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem” (Mosiah 28:20). <br><br>
A comparison of Alma’s teachings with those on the plates of Nephi show that he frequently drew upon the words of his prophetic ancestors. Examples of the influence of the plates of Nephi on Alma’s teachings can be found in his warnings about the dangers of pride and riches, allusions to Lehi’s visions, Nephi’s teachings about the plates and the Liahona, and the plan of happiness. <br><br>
Alma spoke of the dangers of pride and riches to the people of Zarahemla. His teachings and words on this subject are similar to those of Jacob the brother of Nephi on the small plates. In both passages, the prophets are concerned with the negative impact of wealth and prosperity upon the people of Nephi. Both Jacob and Alma speak of riches and the costly apparel of the people. Each condemns the pride of the hearts of the people, in which they suppose that they are better than their brethren, and which leads to persecution (Alma 5:53–54; Jacob 2:13).  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Alma’s words about riches provide a good caution for our day. When we read Alma’s teachings, we should ponder how we can be more fully humble before God and our fellow man, and always treat others as we would like to be treated. Also, Alma drew upon the scriptures in his possession to deal with serious challenges in his life and to know what to teach. We can likewise be blessed as we search the scriptures to find answers and help in dealing with our own challenges.  <br><br>
An additional insight drawn from Alma’s use of these and other teachings from the plates of Nephi may not initially be obvious to the reader. It is generally accepted now that our current text of the Book of Mormon was dictated from Mosiah through 4 Nephi following the loss of the 116 pages of the book of Lehi. This means that Alma’s teachings in this portion of the Book of Mormon were actually dictated by Joseph Smith <b><i>before</i></b> the source material on the small plates (1 Nephi through Omni).  <br><br>
It would, of course, be very difficult for Joseph Smith to remember and keep such details straight, had he been the author of the Book of Mormon. However, Alma’s use of this source material on the small plates is consistent with what the Book of Mormon says (he had the small plates in his possession) and is exactly what one would expect if the Book of Mormon was true.
