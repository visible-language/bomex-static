  <h1 class="content-title">The Brother of Jared and Noah</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">Both Noah in the Genesis account and the Brother of Jared were righteous men who were commanded by God to build water-going vessels for themselves and their families (Genesis 6:14i16; Ether 2:16). Also, God is described as making a covenant with both men relating to the future destruction of man (Genesis 9:8i17; Ether 2:8i12). Similar wording in both the Genesis story and the Jaredite account suggest that Moroni’s choice of language was intentionally designed to draw this connection to the attention of the reader.</p>

      In the Flood story, Noah is described as a righteous man who lived in very wicked times, yet "found <b><i>grace</i></b> in the eyes of the Lord" (Genesis 6:8). The Brother of Jared also lived in a time of wickedness and was "a man highly <b><i>favored</i></b> of the Lord" (Ether 1:34). Biblical scholar E. A. Speiser observed that the Hebrew word sometimes rendered as "found grace" in the Genesis passage literally means "won <b><i>favor,"</i></b> rather than grace.<sup>1</sup>  The comparison between the Brother of Jared and Noah is strengthened by the reference to the Jaredite prophet being highly <b><i>favored.</i></b> <br><br>
In the Genesis account, Noah has wicked contemporaries who are described as "<b><i>mighty men"</i></b> (Genesis 6:4). The Brother Jared is described as a "<b><i>mighty man"</i></b> (Ether 1:34), but one who is righteous. Noah’s ark was to be provisioned with "<b><i>all food</i></b> that is eaten" and carried animals that included "<b><i>fowls</i></b> after their kind" (Genesis 6:21). Similarly, the Brother of Jared "prepared <b><i>all manner of food</i></b>" for himself and his family, as well as for the animals including "<b><i>fowl</i></b> that they should carry with them" (Ether 6:4). <br><br>
Before they were destroyed by the Flood, the people were grossly wicked and "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only <b><i>evil continually"</i></b> (Genesis 6:5). When the Brother of Jared confessed to the Lord, he said that "because of the fall our natures have become <b><i>evil continually"</i></b> (Ether 3:2). The Lord in Noah’s day said, "<b><i>My Spirit will not always strive with man"</i></b> (Genesis 6:3). He admonished the Brother of Jared to "remember that <b><i>my Spirit will not always strive with man"</i></b> (Ether 2:15). The language selected and used by Moroni suggests that when we read and study the book of Ether, we should keep in mind the story of Noah and the Flood.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>Both the Brother of Jared and Noah lived in a time of wickedness, but were greatly favored by God with covenant blessings, which had a profound effect upon themselves and their families. As we study the book of Ether, we should note examples of these blessings in their history, and ponder ways that we can also lay hold upon covenant blessings that the Lord has made available to us.
