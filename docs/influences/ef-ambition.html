  <h1 class="content-title">The Evil Fruit of Unrestrained Ambition and Desire</h1>
<div class="analysis">
In Genesis, when the woman saw that the tree of knowledge of good and evil "<i>was <b>pleasant</b> to the eyes, and a tree to be <b>desired</b> to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat" </i> (Genesis 3:6). In the Ether story, Jared’s daughter introduces her plan as follows:<br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will <b>please</b> him, that he will <b>desire</b> me to wife; wherefore if he shall <b>desire</b> of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king. . . .  <br><br>
When Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she <b>pleased</b> him, insomuch that he <b>desired</b> her to wife </i>(Ether 8:10-11).</p><br><br>
The evil plan described in Ether evokes words that echo Eve’s desire for the fruit of the tree in the story of the Fall. However, in this case, the plan of Jared’s daughter sets up another fall, and by implication, death and destruction for Jared, Akish, and their people, through the introduction of secret combinations to murder and gain power. The evil of unrestrained desire is shown in the case of Akish, whose desire for Jared’s daughter leads him to betray any integrity he once had and attempt the murder of Omer, who "was a friend to Akish" (Ether 8:11).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>In Genesis, the words "pleasant" and "desired" are connected with the temptation of the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, of which Eve partook and gave to her husband, resulting in the death of mankind. Moroni uses similar words to describe the introduction of secret combinations among the Jaredites. In this case, another woman, Jared’s daughter, conspires with her father to cause another man, her future husband Akish, to use evil knowledge in a wicked, murderous plan, which would result in the death and destruction of most of that people. <br><br>
As we read the story of the plot of Akish and Jared’s family, we should ponder how the principles and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ can help us to control our passions and desires, providing safety in our lives.
