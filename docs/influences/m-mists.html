  <h1 class="content-title">Mists of Darkness</h1>
  <p class="content-subtitle">Readers of the Book of Mormon can easily miss how subsequent Book of Mormon prophets adopted the imagery and language of Lehi’s tree-of-life vision in their own teachings to emphasize their importance and to highlight key messages in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<div class="analysis">
      <p>
Father Lehi’s vision of the tree of life provides us with a pattern applicable to our own lives, as we seek to overcome worldly influences and partake of the love of God. Lehi saw that as many were seeking to lay hold upon the word of God that would led them to the tree, "there arose a <b><i>mist of darkness;</i></b> yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that those who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost" (1 Nephi 8:23). He also saw that others took hold of the rod of iron and "did press forward through the mist of darkness" until they were able to come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:24). <br><br>
Later, Lehi’s son Nephi had a vision in which he saw the things his father saw and received an angelic interpretation of the symbols in the dream. The angel taught that "the mists of darkness are the <b><i>temptations</i></b> of the devil, which <b><i>blindeth</i></b> the eyes, and <b><i>hardeneth</i></b> the hearts of the children of men, and <b><i>leadeth them away</i></b> into broad roads, that they perish and are lost" (1 Nephi 12:17). After his vision, Nephi taught his brothers that the rod of iron "was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the <b><i>temptations</i></b> and fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto <b><i>blindness,</i></b> to <b><i>lead them away</i></b> to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24). <br><br>
In Amulek’s teachings to the Zoramites, we see how he draws upon Nephi’s description of the mists of darkness to highlight the importance of daily prayer, so that the temptations of the adversary do not overpower us. Mormon uses this same language to highlight the dangers of apostasy.<br><br>

<div class="analysis">
At the birth of Christ, great signs were given to the people of Nephi; yet, in spite of these events, Mormon relates that many of the people fell back into unbelief and apostasy. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>They began to be <b>hard in their hearts,</b> and <b>blind</b> in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen—<br><br>
Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did <b>blind</b> their eyes and <b>lead them away</b> to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing … <br><br>
And Satan did go about <b>leading away</b> the hearts of the people, <b>tempting</b> them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land</i> (3 Nephi 2:1-3).</p><br>
Like the mists of darkness, the adversary’s temptations hardened the hearts, blinded the eyes, and led away the people of Nephi into wickedness. Mormon’s language, borrowed from Nephi, emphasizes how the mists of darkness worked at this point in Nephite history. Temptations of the devil, left unchecked, can lead us to forget and dismiss even the greatest signs and miracles that have previously occurred in our lives.<br><br>
Mormon’s account underscores the need to hold fast to the word of God, making it a part of our daily life and behavior, even after we have experienced miraculous events and blessings in our lives. We must "watch," or always be alert for danger, and continue in sincere and daily prayer. We must never become careless in our faith and must strive to remember the Lord’s many mercies, lest we become as the Nephites of old.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Practical application</h4><p>By adopting the words of Nephi earlier in his narrative, Mormon skillfully places the apostasy of the Nephites into the setting of Lehi’s dream and likens earlier scriptures to a new circumstance. Attentive readers of the Book of Mormon will benefit from noticing such allusions in the text. This account invites us to see ourselves in Lehi’s dream and use the wisdom found in the Book of Mormon. It will allow us to pass through the mists of darkness, designed to blind us to the joys of God’s love and lead us to misery and destruction. We can then partake of God’s love.
