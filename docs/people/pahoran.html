  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Pahoran was the son of Nephihah and was the third chief judge over the Nephites (Alma 50:39-40). He reigned during a significant period of war between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Based upon the text, he appears to have been a righteous man.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Insights into the Words and phrases</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that Pahoran was humble enough to not become angry when he was falsely accused of being a traitor?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
During his reign, a significant faction of the people, known as "kingmen," agitated to change the law to allow kings instead of judges, which Pahoran rightly did not allow (Alma 51:1-7). This faction continued to cause problems for the Nephites, sometimes refusing to take up arms in defense of the land (Alma 51:13-20), and at other times openly seeking to overthrow the Nephite government. <br><br>
Pahoran and his supporters, known as "freemen," were temporarily driven out of the city of Zarahemla by the kingmen faction led by Pachus and had to take refuge in the land of Gideon (Alma 61:8). While in possession of Zarahemla, the Pachus faction denied support to the armies of Moroni and Helaman, resulting in the loss of the city of Nephihah and the massacre of many of its people (Alma 59:1-11). Moroni, unaware of the kingmen’s coup, initially blamed Pahoran for these difficulties in a pointed letter to the chief judge (Alma 60), but soon was apprised of the true situation by an epistle from Pahoran (Alma 61:1-21).  <br><br>
By joining forces with those of Moroni, the chief judge was able to defeat the army of Pachus and be restored to the judgment seat (Alma 62:1-10). His restoration to the judgment seat and the renewal of support for the Nephite armies helped bring a rapid end to the war.    <br><br>
Pahoran’s words show him to be a man concerned with fulfilling his duty, and grieved about the rebellion against his rule and the suffering of his people, but also one who might not have been entirely sure of how to respond to a perplexing situation (Alma 61:19). It also shows him to be a man of humility, who was not provoked by Moroni’s misdirected threats and accusations. <br><br>
Pahoran and Moroni are the only Book of Mormon speakers to share the phrase "spirit of freedom." Pahoran is the only one to use the words and phrases, "risen up," "avenge our wrongs," "God hath made them free," "God hath made us free," "great flattery," "rebellions and dissensions," "subject ourselves," "alliance," "censured," "daunted," "flocking," and "grieves."  <br><br>
Pahoran uses the words "risen up" (as in rebelled), "resist," and "rebellions" more frequently than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. This is clearly the distinguishing topic of his letter. All other occurrences of "risen up" in the Book of Mormon refer to the resurrection of the dead. Pahoran refers to "freemen," "freedom," "free," and "liberty" at a higher rate than do other Book of Mormon speakers. Only he and Alma use the phrase "requisite with the justice of God."  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Pahoran’s words show that he was a righteous and humble leader, not easily provoked, but committed to maintaining a righteous Nephite government, so the people might remain free from the bondage of unrighteous leaders and sin. His response to Moroni’s misdirected threats shows how followers of Christ can respond to unfair or misdirected accusations and reproof. When we read Pahoran’s words, we should ponder how we can each be more patient in the face of unkind words and not be easily offended.

The phrase, "stand fast in [the] liberty wherewith God hath made [us] free," was first used by Alma I in the land of Helam, when his people wanted to make him a king. <br><br>
<p style="margin-left: 5%;"><i>And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.  <br><br>
And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye <b>should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free,</b> and that ye trust no man to be a king over you </i>(Mosiah 23:12-13).</p>  <br>
This teaching is also used by Helaman the son of Alma II and the Nephite chief judge, Pahoran. The phrase is rooted in the idea that kings and unrighteous leaders will lead their people into iniquity. King Mosiah’s abandonment of government by kingship for government by judges was based upon the Lord’s commandments (Mosiah 29:30). The idea that an unrighteous king would inevitably lead his people to serious iniquity was a defining issue for the Nephites during the reign of the judges (Mosiah 29:12-36). <br><br>
Helaman wrote concerning his young warriors: "But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come" (Alma 58:40).  <br><br>
Similarly, Pahoran’s uses of Alma’s phrase in his epistle (Alma 61:9, 21) signaled to Moroni that, as chief judge, he too was fully committed to righteous government and the fulfillment of his oath (Alma 50:39). He opposed the efforts of the kingmen to replace him with a king because he knew that such would lead to bondage from sin, as well as political bondage.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The phrase "stand fast in the liberty wherewith God has made us free" refers to more than political liberty; it is also freedom from sin. Men like Alma I, Helaman, and Moroni knew all too well that unrighteous leaders seeking power would lead their people into iniquity. When we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how we can avoid being led astray by the unrighteous examples of others, and how we can stand in holy places and obtain the blessings that freedom from sin through Christ can bring to our lives.
