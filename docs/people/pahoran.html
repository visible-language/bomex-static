  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Pahoran was the son of Nephihah and was the third chief judge over the Nephites (Alma 50:39-40). He reigned during a significant period of war between the Nephites and the Lamanites. Based upon the text, he appears to have been a righteous man.</p>

      <p>
During his reign, a significant faction of the people, known as "kingmen," agitated to change the law to allow kings instead of judges, which Pahoran rightly did not allow (Alma 51:1-7). This faction continued to cause problems for the Nephites, sometimes refusing to take up arms in defense of the land (Alma 51:13-20), and at other times openly seeking to overthrow the Nephite government. <br><br>
Pahoran and his supporters, known as "freemen," were temporarily driven out of the city of Zarahemla by the kingmen faction led by Pachus and had to take refuge in the land of Gideon (Alma 61:8). While in possession of Zarahemla, the Pachus faction denied support to the armies of Moroni and Helaman, resulting in the loss of the city of Nephihah and the massacre of many of its people (Alma 59:1-11). Moroni, unaware of the kingmen’s coup, initially blamed Pahoran for these difficulties in a pointed letter to the chief judge (Alma 60), but soon was apprised of the true situation by an epistle from Pahoran (Alma 61:1-21).  <br><br>
By joining forces with those of Moroni, the chief judge was able to defeat the army of Pachus and be restored to the judgment seat (Alma 62:1-10). His restoration to the judgment seat and the renewal of support for the Nephite armies helped bring a rapid end to the war.    <br><br>
Pahoran’s words show him to be a man concerned with fulfilling his duty, and grieved about the rebellion against his rule and the suffering of his people, but also one who might not have been entirely sure of how to respond to a perplexing situation (Alma 61:19). It also shows him to be a man of humility, who was not provoked by Moroni’s misdirected threats and accusations. <br><br>
Pahoran and Moroni are the only Book of Mormon speakers to share the phrase "spirit of freedom." Pahoran is the only one to use the words and phrases, "risen up," "avenge our wrongs," "God hath made them free," "God hath made us free," "great flattery," "rebellions and dissensions," "subject ourselves," "alliance," "censured," "daunted," "flocking," and "grieves."  <br><br>
Pahoran uses the words "risen up" (as in rebelled), "resist," and "rebellions" more frequently than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. This is clearly the distinguishing topic of his letter. All other occurrences of "risen up" in the Book of Mormon refer to the resurrection of the dead. Pahoran refers to "freemen," "freedom," "free," and "liberty" at a higher rate than do other Book of Mormon speakers. Only he and Alma use the phrase "requisite with the justice of God."  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Pahoran’s words show that he was a righteous and humble leader, not easily provoked, but committed to maintaining a righteous Nephite government, so the people might remain free from the bondage of unrighteous leaders and sin. His response to Moroni’s misdirected threats shows how followers of Christ can respond to unfair or misdirected accusations and reproof. When we read Pahoran’s words, we should ponder how we can each be more patient in the face of unkind words and not be easily offended.
