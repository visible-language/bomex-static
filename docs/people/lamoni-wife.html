  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>This Lamanite queen lived around 90 B.C. in the land of Ishmael. King Lamoni’s wife is described as a woman of great faith; her faith, according to the missionary prophet Ammon, exceeded that of the Nephites (Alma 19:10). When her husband fell to the earth and was unconscious for days, some of her servants tried to persuade her that he was dead and should be buried (Alma 19:5). Hearing that Ammon was a prophet, she sought his counsel. He promised her that the king was not dead, but would rise on the morrow (Alma 19:8). When the king indeed rose again, she too was overcome by the Spirit and received a testimony of Christ’s redemption.</p>

One is struck by the joyous phrases that seem to burst from the lips of this remarkable faithful woman. As we read her words, we should ponder how her faith in the words of the prophet Ammon brought such joy into her life, and how our own faithful obedience to the teachings of Christ through his latter-day servants can also bring us such exquisite happiness.
