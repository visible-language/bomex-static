  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Moroni was chief captain over the Nephite armies during the early reign of the judges. He was appointed chief captain at the age of 25 and served for 17 years (Alma 43:3-4, 16-17; 62:43, 52). The reign of the judges began when he was 7. When he was 12, he would have witnessed the devastating war between the Nephites and the Amlicites and Lamanites, in which tens of thousands of his people were slain, including many women and children (Alma 2:19; 3:1-2; 4:1-3).</p>

      <p>
At the age of 22, he would have witnessed and likely participated in the devastating war against the Lamanites, following the arrival of the Lamanite converts in the land of Jershon. The text indicates that this battle was the most tremendous that had ever occurred among the people of Lehi up until that time, resulting again in the death of "many thousands" (Alma 28:9-12). <br><br>
During his time as chief captain, Moroni directed innovations in defensive armor (Alma 43:18-21; 44:9), fortifications (Alma 48:8; 49:1-25; 50:1-6), and forced relocation and settlement (Alma 50:7-18), designed to reduce casualties. He also pursued a relatively lenient policy toward defeated enemy combatants (Alma 44:19-20; 62:16-17) and prisoners, compared to his enemies. (Compare his actions in Alma 52:38-40; 53:1-5 with those of Ammoron (Alma 56:12).) One can see these significant innovations being motivated by a desire to protect his people from the devastation they had seen in earlier conflicts. One may also wonder if his ascendancy to chief captain at a young age may have been attributed, not only to his own abilities, but also due to the great losses of men and leadership in earlier conflicts. <br><br>
The text also shows Moroni to be a man of God, as well as a great military leader (Alma 48:11-18). He knew and cited scripture (Alma 46:24-26; 60:23). He was faithful to covenants (Alma 44:4, 11; 46:12-23) and he was willing to seek and follow the counsel of prophets like Alma (Alma 43:23-24) and defend them (Alma 46:1-3, 11). He suffered at least one serious injury (Alma 52:35) and there are references to his suffering with his men, "all manner of afflictions of every kind" and "exceedingly great sufferings," including "hunger, thirst, and fatigue" (Alma 60:3). He was a much loved, successful, and effective leader, but it is possible that the physical and psychological demands of his service may have taken their toll, leading to his death the year after his retirement at the relatively early age of 43. <br><br>

<p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that Moroni uses the word &quot;religion&quot; more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon?</em></p><div class="analysis">
<p> 
As might be expected, Moroni’s language includes words and phrases that echo his violent occupation. He speaks of the "wounded and bleeding" (Alma 60:22), speaks graphically of those who have "bled out their lives" (Alma 60:9), and tells the incalcitrant Zoramite rebel that he would "spill [his] blood upon the ground" (Alma 44:11). He warns the impenitent Ammoron of God’s vengeance, telling of "the <i>sword</i> of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you" (Alma 54:6). <br><br>
Captain Moroni’s use of the word "religion" is statistically significant. Out of the 10 references to "religion" in the Book of Mormon, seven come from the Nephite captain. In fact, in six of those seven, he refers to "our religion." He is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use that phrase. His use of the word "freedom" is also significant.  Of the 29 times the word "freedom" is used by Book of Mormon speakers in 264,000 words, it is spoken by Captain Moroni seven times in only 3067 words.  This means he uses "freedom" over 30 times more frequently than all of the other Book of Mormon speakers.  Obviously, religion and freedom are central to his message.
Only Moroni uses the name "all-powerful God," and he does so specifically in the context of emphasizing how God had blessed his army to be victorious over a superior foe (Alma 44:5). <br><br>
Other words and phrases unique to Moroni include "be up and doing" (Alma 60:24), "inward," "neglected," "slothfulness," "thoughtless," "adhere," "awaits," "bestir," "binds," "bleeding," "conflict," "decayed," "hearkening," "impede," "insurrections," "manage," "operate," "prisoner," "proposed," "redoubled," "spark," "spill," "stated," "stupor," "succored," and "traitors."<br><br>
Moroni was conversant with his scriptural heritage. He quotes from a prophecy from the patriarch Jacob, not found in the Bible, which he applies to his people and their enemies in a covenant ceremony (Alma 46:24-26). He also makes an interesting reference to the practice, under the law of Moses, of the cleansing of vessels (Leviticus 11:32-33; Numbers 19:14-15), indicating that this was a practice known to Moroni and kept by the Nephites under that law (Alma 60:23).<sup>1</sup> <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Moroni’s example shows that one can be a servant of God, even during the most difficult of times. His faith in the words of the prophets, his faithfulness to sacred covenants, and his courage were a great blessing to his people as he defended their liberties and their religion. When we read the words of Moroni, we should ponder how we can develop greater faith and faithfulness in our own lives.
