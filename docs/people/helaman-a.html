  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Helaman was one of the sons of Alma II and became high priest over the Church, following the departure of his father. During the long war with the Lamanites, Helaman led a force of 2000 sons of the Ammonite converts. Their military actions were a key factor in the victory of the Nephite forces in the southern quarter of the land and the recapture of Nephite possessions in that sector. Helaman’s words come primarily from a lengthy letter he wrote to Captain Moroni, who was the chief commander over the Nephite forces during the war.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Did you know that Helaman’s words show how the scriptures can help to sustain us and increase our faith, even in difficult times?</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The main focus of Helaman’s epistle is war, and this is reflected in his language. Only Helaman uses the words "supply," "surrendered," "sallying," "secrete," "faction," "movements," "retreats," "toiling," "weariness," "convey," "opposed," and "ordered." These are all words associated with the labors and strategies of armies. Helaman uses other words and phrases which, although used by other Book of Mormon voices, expand his military vocabulary. These include references to army sizes, cities as objects of defense or attack, "prisoners," "march," "army," and "strength." <br><br>
Helaman uses the verb "deliver" five times, in the sense of delivering weapons or prisoners to an opposing force or to confinement elsewhere. Another five times, "deliver" is used in reference to God delivering Helaman and his people from their enemies. Helaman’s words suggest that he understood the events of his life through the lens of the scriptures, and that he benefited from a knowledge of the plates of brass. Examples of this can be seen in his use of war strategies likely found on the plates of brass and the Lord’s counsel to his ancestor Joshua (See <i>Helaman’s War Strategies</i> and <i>God’s Counsel to Joshua</i> in this directory). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Helaman’s language is consistent with that of a man experienced with war, but it also shows how faith in God can support one through such experiences. When we read Helaman’s words, we should ponder how we can view our own challenges through the eye of faith and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord, even in the most difficult circumstances.
