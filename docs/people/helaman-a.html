  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Helaman was one of the sons of Alma II and became high priest over the Church, following the departure of his father. During the long war with the Lamanites, Helaman led a force of 2000 sons of the Ammonite converts. Their military actions were a key factor in the victory of the Nephite forces in the southern quarter of the land and the recapture of Nephite possessions in that sector. Helaman’s words come primarily from a lengthy letter he wrote to Captain Moroni, who was the chief commander over the Nephite forces during the war.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Insights into the Words and phrases</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that Helaman’s words show how the scriptures can help to sustain us and increase our faith, even in difficult times?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The main focus of Helaman’s epistle is war, and this is reflected in his language. Only Helaman uses the words "supply," "surrendered," "sallying," "secrete," "faction," "movements," "retreats," "toiling," "weariness," "convey," "opposed," and "ordered." These are all words associated with the labors and strategies of armies. Helaman uses other words and phrases which, although used by other Book of Mormon voices, expand his military vocabulary. These include references to army sizes, cities as objects of defense or attack, "prisoners," "march," "army," and "strength." <br><br>
Helaman uses the verb "deliver" five times, in the sense of delivering weapons or prisoners to an opposing force or to confinement elsewhere. Another five times, "deliver" is used in reference to God delivering Helaman and his people from their enemies. Helaman’s words suggest that he understood the events of his life through the lens of the scriptures, and that he benefited from a knowledge of the plates of brass. Examples of this can be seen in his use of war strategies likely found on the plates of brass and the Lord’s counsel to his ancestor Joshua (See <i>Helaman’s War Strategies</i> and <i>God’s Counsel to Joshua</i> in this directory). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Helaman’s language is consistent with that of a man experienced with war, but it also shows how faith in God can support one through such experiences. When we read Helaman’s words, we should ponder how we can view our own challenges through the eye of faith and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord, even in the most difficult circumstances.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>God’s Counsel to Joshua: Helaman and His &quot;Sons&quot;</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that in his report to Moroni on the progress of the war, Helaman draws upon the Lord’s words of counsel to Joshua prior to the Israelite conquest of the Canaanites in the land of promise?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
In his letter to Moroni, the prophet Helaman, the son of Alma, uses phrases from God’s counsel to Joshua to recount how he and his army of stripling warriors overcame their challenges in the war with the Lamanites. The confidence of the young striplings that "<b><i>God is with us</i></b>" (Alma 56:46) recalls the Lord’s promise to Joshua that, "as I was with Moses, <b><i>so I will be with thee:</i></b> I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Joshua 1:5), and "the Lord thy <b><i>God is with thee</i></b>" (Joshua 1:9). <br><br>
The Lord counseled Joshua to "be <b><i>strong</i></b> and of a good <b><i>courage</i></b>" (Joshua 1:6, 9), and "be thou <b><i>strong</i></b> and <b><i>very courageous</i></b>" (Joshua 1:7). Helaman stresses the courage of his little army. "Never had I seen so <b><i>great courage,</i></b> nay, not among all the Nephites" (Alma 56:45; 58:12). Helaman notes that he and his Ammonite force "were <b><i>not strong</i></b>, according to our numbers" (Alma 58:15), yet they were strong in the faith of God and their obedience to His commandments. "Their faith is <b><i>strong</i></b> in the prophecies concerning that which is to come" (Alma 58:40). <br><br>
Recognizing their numerical weakness, they looked to God for strength. "Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would <b><i>strengthen</i></b> us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us <b><i>strength</i></b>" (Alma 58:10). Such strength was given them that they frightened their enemies, even though they were fewer in numbers.  "They had fought as if with the <b><i>strength of God;</i></b> yea, never were men known to have fought with such <b><i>miraculous strength;</i></b> and with such mighty power" (Alma 56:56).<br><br>
Helaman states that when their enemies pursued them, they "durst <b><i>not turn to the right nor to the left</i></b> lest they should be surrounded; neither would I <b><i>turn to the right nor to the left</i></b> lest they should overtake me" (Alma 56:40). This phrase echoes the Lord’s counsel to Joshua that he "<b><i>observe</i></b> to do" God’s law and "<b><i>turn not from it to the right hand or to the left</i></b>" (Joshua 1:7). The decisive efforts of Helaman’s forces led to a Nephite victory. <br><br>
Helaman says that his young army "did obey and <b><i>observe</i></b> to perform every word of command with exactness" (Alma 57:21). This military discipline was equaled by their moral rectitude: They never deviated from their obligations to God. Helaman says, "they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do <b><i>observe</i></b> to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually" (Alma 58:40).<br><br>
The words "right" and "left" are used together by several other Book of Mormon speakers in reference to those on the right or left hand of God at the day of judgment (Mosiah 5:10, 12), to God’s ways (Alma 7:20; 3 Nephi 29:9), and to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were willing to stand unmovable, even in the face of death (Alma 24:23). Only Helaman uses it in connection with the movement of armies.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>By employing the language of the Lord to his Josephite ancestor Joshua, the prophet Helaman underscored how he and his young warriors were faithful and obedient to the Lord’s commandments, and were thereby blessed with success during a difficult and challenging time. When we read Helaman’s letter to Moroni, we should ponder how we can find greater blessings in our own difficulties, by increasing our faith and obedience to the words of the Lord.

Helaman’s words suggest that he was familiar with military texts, such as the book of Joshua on the plates of brass, and alluded to them to teach the importance of faithfulness and obedience to God. Helaman’s father Alma had entrusted him with the plates of brass and reminded him of their value (Alma 37:3-20). Evidence suggests that Helaman took this counsel to heart and studied earlier military accounts, such as the book of Joshua, a version of which was presumably included in those records. <br><br>
The tactics used to recapture the city of Manti are similar to those used by the Israelites in their successful campaign against the Canaanite fortress of Ai. <br><br>
<ol>
  <li>There is an assurance of victory (Joshua 8:1; Alma 58:10-11), </li>
  <li>A small force pitches their tents outside the city (Joshua 8:10-11; Alma 58:13),</li> 
  <li>An ambush is set (Joshua 8:4, 12-13; Alma 58:18), </li>
  <li>The enemy army is decoyed out of their fortifications by the smaller army (Joshua 8:14-15; Alma 58:19), and</li>
  <li>The hidden ambush party captures the city (Joshua 8:17, 19; Alma 58:20-22). </li>
</ol>
These similarities are particularly interesting because the Israelite victory over Ai followed on the heels of a disastrous defeat, due to Israel’s transgression. Israel was unable to proceed with their campaign until the transgression was dealt with (Joshua 7). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Helaman’s account of the eventual victory of his army underscores the miraculous blessings that are available when the Lord’s people, like Helaman’s young warriors, are universally faithful. This faithfulness helped them to maintain their liberty and protect their people against their enemies. <br><br>
When we read Helaman’s account, we should ponder how a knowledge of the scriptures can help us to be successful in our daily struggles and remain faithful, even when surrounded by wickedness and those who promote it. A knowledge of the scriptures and their worth helps us to live righteous lives and pursue lasting happiness.
