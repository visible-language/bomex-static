  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Ammon was a strong man who was a descendant of Zarahemla (Mosiah 7:3). Around 121 B.C., he led a search party of sixteen men from the land of Zarahemla to the land of Nephi to determine what had happened to the people of Zeniff, who had journeyed to that land several generations earlier. After locating the remnants of Zeniff’s people, Ammon was able to help deliver them and lead them back to the land of Zarahemla.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Ammon Descendant of Zarahemla</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Ammon’s words to King Limhi provide the most detailed description of the role of a seer in the scriptures?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
We only have 198 words from Ammon in the Book of Mormon text. He uses the words "assured" and "assuredly" once each. No other speaker says "assured." The word "assuredly" is only used four other times in the text. When Ammon arrived in the land of Nephi, the people of King Limhi (Zeniff’s grandson) mistakenly believed that the land of Zarahemla had been destroyed. When Limhi learned that the people of Zarahemla were alive, he was "exceedingly glad" (Mosiah 7:14). Ammon’s assurance to Limhi would have been a great comfort to the king. Ammon’s statement that he was a descendant of Zarahemla was important because all the people of Zarahemla were erroneously thought to be dead. The people of Zarahemla were alive, as evidenced by the descendant of Zarahemla standing before the king. <br><br>
Ammon’s teachings about the role of a seer were also important because Limhi wanted to obtain a translation of the records that his people had found (Mosiah 8:13-18). While other prophets in the scriptures refer to seers, Ammon provides the most detailed description of their role. Because Limhi’s people had not followed the counsel of prophets, such as Abinadi, they were in a state of blindness and bondage. The seers among the people of Nephi were a great blessing to the people. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Ammon’s teachings about the divine role of seers reminds us of the importance of seers in our own day. As we read the account of Ammon and Limhi’s people, we should ponder how blind we would be without the counsel of contemporary prophets, and seek to more diligently follow their counsel.
