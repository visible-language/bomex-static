  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Mormon was the chief commander over the armies of the Nephites during their last decades as a people (Mormon 1-6) and the keeper of their sacred history during that time. He was a disciple of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 5:12-13) and a great prophet. During his final years, he compiled an abridgment of the records in his custody on plates named after him, which he entrusted to his son, Moroni.</p>

Given his role as the primary historian of the Book of Mormon, it is not surprising that Mormon’s favorite word relating to time is the word "year" (262 times). Exclusive to Mormon is the phrase "year of the reign of the judges over the people" (46) and the word "fifth" (27). It is also not surprising that he focuses on those about whom he is writing, such as "the Lamanites" (519), "people" (244), "the people" (386), "the people of" (264), "of Nephi" (208), and "the Nephites" (311). <br><br>
The majority of geographical references in the Book of Mormon come from Mormon. Words and phrases relating to locations include "city" (191), "the land" (171), "the land of" (259), "of the land" (164), and "in the land" (147). Most words and phrases dealing with geography are from Mormon. Book of Mormon geography is essentially Mormon’s map.<br><br>
Mormon’s favorite words of named and unnamed individuals include Alma (244), Moroni (182), Ammon (160), "king" (136), and "the king" (214). Most numerous are words for Deity. These include "the Lord" (312), "God" (200), "of God" (237), and "Christ" (140), which combined together constitute a substantial number (689). <br><br>
Mormon often refers to Christ indirectly, through phrases such as the "light of Christ" (Moroni 7:18-19), "Spirit of Christ" (Moroni 7:16), "atonement of Christ" (Moroni 7:41), "word of Christ" (Moroni 7:31), "power and gift of Christ" (Moroni 7:16), "mercies of Christ" (Moroni 8:20), and "alive in Christ" (Moroni 8:12, 22). When using the name of Jesus Christ, Mormon usually augments the name with the more formal title "<i>Lord</i> Jesus Christ" (Moroni 7:2; 8:2; 9:26). Only Mormon uses the title "Holy Child, Jesus" (Moroni 8:3).<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Words for deity are a significant characteristic of Mormon’s style and message, including words that reflect blessings associated with Christ. As we ponder the writings of Mormon, we should carefully examine how we can more fully partake of these blessings and make the needed changes in our lives.
