  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Mormon was the chief commander over the armies of the Nephites during their last decades as a people (Mormon 1-6) and the keeper of their sacred history during that time. He was a disciple of Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 5:12-13) and a great prophet. During his final years, he compiled an abridgment of the records in his custody on plates named after him, which he entrusted to his son, Moroni.</p>

      <p>
Given his role as the primary historian of the Book of Mormon, it is not surprising that Mormon’s favorite word relating to time is the word "year" (262 times). Exclusive to Mormon is the phrase "year of the reign of the judges over the people" (46) and the word "fifth" (27). It is also not surprising that he focuses on those about whom he is writing, such as "the Lamanites" (519), "people" (244), "the people" (386), "the people of" (264), "of Nephi" (208), and "the Nephites" (311). <br><br>
The majority of geographical references in the Book of Mormon come from Mormon. Words and phrases relating to locations include "city" (191), "the land" (171), "the land of" (259), "of the land" (164), and "in the land" (147). Most words and phrases dealing with geography are from Mormon. Book of Mormon geography is essentially Mormon’s map.<br><br>
Mormon’s favorite words of named and unnamed individuals include Alma (244), Moroni (182), Ammon (160), "king" (136), and "the king" (214). Most numerous are words for Deity. These include "the Lord" (312), "God" (200), "of God" (237), and "Christ" (140), which combined together constitute a substantial number (689). <br><br>
Mormon often refers to Christ indirectly, through phrases such as the "light of Christ" (Moroni 7:18-19), "Spirit of Christ" (Moroni 7:16), "atonement of Christ" (Moroni 7:41), "word of Christ" (Moroni 7:31), "power and gift of Christ" (Moroni 7:16), "mercies of Christ" (Moroni 8:20), and "alive in Christ" (Moroni 8:12, 22). When using the name of Jesus Christ, Mormon usually augments the name with the more formal title "<i>Lord</i> Jesus Christ" (Moroni 7:2; 8:2; 9:26). Only Mormon uses the title "Holy Child, Jesus" (Moroni 8:3).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Words for deity are a significant characteristic of Mormon’s style and message, including words that reflect blessings associated with Christ. As we ponder the writings of Mormon, we should carefully examine how we can more fully partake of these blessings and make the needed changes in our lives.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Dating Mormon’s Letter to Moroni (Moroni 9)</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that Moroni 9 was written shortly before the final battle at Cumorah?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
While both Moroni 9 and the abridged material in Mormon 1-6 were written by Mormon, the letter is a contemporary expression by Mormon, while the abridged material is his later brief summary and commentary about his people’s fall over 62 years. Since the letters were written first and the abridgment later, words and themes in the letter that also appear in Mormon 1-6 help the reader to date the events in Moroni 9. <br><br>
Mormon uses the words "horrible scene" in both Mormon 4:11 and Moroni 9:20. These are the only references to these words in the Book of Mormon, and both are used by Mormon. When Mormon describes the state of bloodshed and evil among his people, he says it "doth exceed everything; yea, <b><i>tongue</i></b> cannot tell, neither can it be <b><i>written</i></b>" (Moroni 9:19). He uses similar language in speaking of the Nephites. "And it is impossible for the <b><i>tongue</i></b> to describe, or for man to <b><i>write</i></b> a perfect description" (Mormon 4:11). <br><br>
Mormon laments his people’s wickedness, noting that "only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a <b><i>delightsome people</i></b>" (Moroni 9:12). In Mormon 5:17, just before he describes the events at the hill Cumorah, Mormon says, "they were once a <b><i>delightsome people</i></b>" (Mormon 5:17). In both letters to his son, Mormon expresses the concern, "I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them" (Moroni 8:28; 9:4). In Mormon 5:16, he expresses this as an accomplished fact: "For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive" with them (Mormon 5:16).  <br><br>
Mormon was forbidden to preach to his people until A.D. 350 (Mormon 1:16-17; 3:2-3). He did not resume command over the Nephite armies until around A.D. 375. In his letter, he refers both to his preaching and his work as commander (Moroni 9:2, 4, 18). These factors, and the similar wording found in both his letter to Moroni and his abridgment in Mormon 4-5, suggest that the letter and the abridged material were written close to the same time.

<b>Key Insights<b> <br><br>
Shared phrases in Moroni 9 and Mormon 4-5 show that Mormon’s letter in Moroni 9 was likely written not long before the Nephites gathered at Cumorah for their final battle, most likely sometime between A.D. 375 and 379. If we pay close attention to similar words and phrases in Moroni 9 and Mormon 1-6, we can receive new insights into the historical setting.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Endurance of Faith</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that the phrase &quot;endurance of faith&quot; teaches us what it means to endure to the end?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The phrase, "endurance of faith," is an example of a binomial pair (where two nouns are linked by a preposition such as "and"). Binomial pairs do not normally appear in the Bible or modern English and appear to be unique to the language of the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
These words highlight the truth that faith in Jesus Christ is not a one-time-only attribute or activity. It requires time and experience to develop and deepen, often in the midst of serious challenges, troubles, and afflictions, which must be endured and overcome. The phrase "endurance of faith" is only used by Mormon (Moroni 8:3) and his son Moroni (Moroni 3:3), suggesting that Moroni may have learned it from his father. Both of these prophets had abundant experience in such endurance as they witnessed the increasing wickedness and ultimate destruction of their people, but faithfully persisted in lives of service, looking forward to future blessings available through Christ. <br><br>
The endurance of faith is encapsulated in Mormon’s counsel to Moroni: "And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God" (Moroni 9:6). It means allowing our faith in Christ and His victory over sin and death to carry us across the gulf of misery and despair (Moroni 9:25-26; Helaman 3:27-30).<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The endurance of faith is not passive; it is active persistence in faithful service and righteousness, even in a hard and unrighteous world. Like Mormon and Moroni, we should labor diligently to increase our faith in Jesus Christ, and faithfully persist in lives of service, looking forward to the future blessings available through Christ.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Mormon and Great Joy</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that when Mormon used the adjective &quot;great,&quot; the most common object was joy?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Mormon uses the adjective "great" 274 times in the Book of Mormon. Notably, the most common object of this word is joy, as in "great joy" (17 times), followed by "power" (12), "destruction" (10), and "things" (10). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Mormon lived through the last years of his people and witnessed their horrible decline into wickedness and depravity.  His life was, consequently, filled with much sorrow. In light of this, having seen so much in his life that was evil and discouraging, it is significant that in his writings, he focused upon the great joy that was available through the living Christ and his eternal gospel. Reasons for such joy are grounded in the mercies and blessings which the Lord bestowed upon his people, as recorded in the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
Just as focusing on Christ gave Mormon's life a foundation of great joy, reading the testimonies and teachings found in the Book of Mormon can be a source of immeasurable joy to us and can help us through the many trials and challenges of life.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Mormon’s Use of &quot;Command&quot; and &quot;Earth&quot;</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that Mormon uses certain words in a manner that is distinct from other Book of Mormon writers?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Certain words used by Mormon often differ in meaning from how they are used by other Book of Mormon speakers. One study found that he "uses <i>command</i> to mean `leadership’ and is completely unique in this usage. Second, most of these uses are secular in nature; i.e., secular leaders give various commands. The exception to this is when Mormon is not editing and speaks for himself---in that case, the Lord commands." <sup>1</sup><br><br>
Mormon’s use of the word "earth" is also significant. Nephi tends to speak of the earth theologically or in broad cosmic terms. God’s power can cause the earth to pass away (1 Nephi 17:46). The seed of Joseph will not perish as long as the earth shall stand (2 Nephi 25:21-22). What he seals on earth shall be sealed in heaven (2 Nephi 33:15). In contrast to Nephi, Mormon’s use of earth tends to be more local and usually refers to the ground. <sup>2</sup><br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Mormon’s distinctive use of words like "command" and "earth" reveal a dimension of his writing style that differs from other Book of Mormon writers. By paying careful attention to how Book of Mormon writers use vocabulary, we can better understand and appreciate their messages.
