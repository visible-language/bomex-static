  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Jacob was Lehi’s fifth son and was born during the family’s difficult wilderness journey to the land of promise. When the family separated after the death of Lehi, Jacob followed his brother Nephi and was consecrated as a priest over Nephi’s people. Nephi recorded some of Jacob’s prophecies on the small plates, and following Nephi’s death, Jacob and his descendants continued to keep the record.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jacob Son of Lehi</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Jacob’s words often reflect his calling as a priest in the temple?  His words also show an ability to paint vivid images and suggest that his emotions may have been close to the surface at times.</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Jacob refers to Christ's role as a creator more than any other Book of Mormon speaker. He uses terms such as "Maker" (2 Nephi 9:40; Jacob 2:6), "great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:5-6; Jacob 3:7), and "all-powerful Creator" (Jacob 2:5). Jacob uses the divine title "Holy One of Israel" 17 times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. Others who use the title include Nephi (10 times), Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (7 times), Amaleki (2 times), Lehi (2 times), and Zenos (2 times). Significantly, all of these titles are found in the words of writers on the small plates, except for 3 Nephi 22:5, where Jesus quotes Isaiah. <br><br>
The phrase "the power of" occurs 17 times in Jacob's writings. It is primarily used in reference to God and His power manifested through His words, the atonement and resurrection, justice, and the Holy Ghost. Only once does it refer to the power of the devil.   <br><br>
Interestingly, among Book of Mormon speakers, Jacob has the second highest number of exclusive words and phrases.  Exclusive words are words that he uses and no other speaker uses.  Only Isaiah in the Book of Mormon has more exclusive words (89), yet Jacob's exclusive words appear at a rate of 85/10,000 words compared to Isaiah's rate of 69/10,000 words.  Although Isaiah's writing style and his message are widely recognized as being unique, Jacob is actually a more unique speaker.  <br><br>
Jacob shows an ability to portray abstract concepts in vivid images. His characterization of death, hell, the devil, and endless torment as an "awful monster" is notable (2 Nephi 9:10, 19, 26). In his temple sermon condemning sin, he speaks of "the piercing eye of the Almighty God" (Jacob 2:10), and reminds the rich and proud that "with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust" (Jacob 2:15). He fears that his words will "enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded" and will be like "daggers placed to pierce [the] souls and wound [the] delicate minds" of the vulnerable (Jacob 2:9).  <br><br>
Jacob talks more about his feelings than other Book of Mormon speakers. His language often seems more personal and intimate.<sup>1</sup>  In his parting blessing, Lehi indicates that Jacob had been abused and treated harshly by his older brothers, Laman and Lemuel: "And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren" (2 Nephi 2:1). Yet, he had also been blessed with a remarkable testimony of Christ: "And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:4).  <br><br>
Jacob's empathy, perhaps gained through his own earlier afflictions, is evident in his words and manifests itself in a reluctance (based on his concern for the vulnerable) to preach harsh messages, even when he must. He feels "weighed down" (Jacob 2:3), it <b><i>grieves him</i></b> (Jacob 2:6-7), and it is a <b><i>burden</i></b> (Jacob 2:9). This language provides a window into his soul. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Jacob's sensitive yet bold personality is evident in his words, a characteristic of his style that sets him apart from other Book of Mormon speakers. When we read about Jacob and study his words, we should ponder how we can be kinder and more sensitive toward others in our teaching, without failing in our duties and responsibilities to God.
<br><br><br>
<sup>1</sup>  John Tanner, in a study of Jacob's words, observes that "half the [Book of Mormon] citations of 'anxiety' occur in the book of Jacob, and over two-thirds of the references to 'grieve,' 'tender,' and 'shame' (or their derivatives) appear in Jacob's writings. He is the only person to use 'delicate,' 'contempt,' and 'lonesome.' Likewise, only Jacob uses 'wound' to refer to emotional, not physical, injuries, as in the rest of the Book of Mormon. Similarly, he uses 'pierce' or its variants frequently (four of the ten instances) and exclusively in a spiritual sense. Such lexical evidence suggests an author who lives close to his emotions." <br><br>

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jacob and the Greatness of God</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Jacob uses the words &quot;great&quot; and &quot;greatness&quot; to refer to God and His works more often than any other Book of Mormon speaker?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Lehi blessed his son Jacob before his death, he noted that, notwithstanding his afflictions, his son knew of "the greatness of God" (2 Nephi 2:2). Jacob’s knowledge of God’s greatness is indeed reflected in his sermons to the people of Nephi. Jacob speaks of God’s "greatness" (2 Nephi 9:53). Three times, he speaks of "the great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:5-6; Jacob 3:7). He also speaks of "the greatness of the Holy One of Israel" (2 Nephi 9:40). <br><br>
In addition to his characterization of the Lord as great, Jacob draws attention to, and even marvels at, the many attributes of God that make Him great. He speaks of the great "<b><i>goodness</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:10), the great "<b><i>holiness</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:20), "the greatness of the <b><i>mercy</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:19, 53), his "great <b><i>mercy"</i></b> (Jacob 4:10), "the greatness and the <b><i>justice</i></b> of our God" (2 Nephi 9:17), "his greatness and his <b><i>grace"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:53), his "great <b><i>condescensions</i></b> unto the children of men" (Jacob 4:7; 2 Nephi 9:53), and the "great and marvelous . . . <b><i>works</i></b> of the Lord" (Jacob 4:8). Significantly, he also speaks of the "great <b><i>plan of our God"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:13), His "great <b><i>plan of redemption"</i></b> (Jacob 6:8), and rejoices in His great "<b><i>covenants"</i></b> (2 Nephi 9:53) and great "<b><i>promises,"</i></b> which He makes available to His children (2 Nephi 10:9, 21). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
While other Book of Mormon speakers and writers use the words "great" and "greatness," Jacob applies these words to God and His characteristics with greater variety and frequency than any other Book of Mormon prophet. This is a significant theme that runs through Jacob’s teachings and is a distinct characteristic of his words, setting him apart from other Book of Mormon speakers. Readers of Jacob’s words should ponder how it was that Jacob came to understand God’s greatness, in spite of his many afflictions and challenges, and perhaps strive to do likewise.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jacob and the Temple</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Jacob often uses words that reflect his calling as a priest in the temple?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Lehi said that Jacob’s days would be "spent in the service of thy God" (2 Nephi 2:3), and Jacob and his younger brother Joseph were consecrated by Nephi to be the first priests over the people of Nephi (2 Nephi 5:26). Notably, Jacob’s vocabulary reflects this calling as a righteous priest. <br><br>
Jacob uses the noun "atonement" eight times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon (2 Nephi 9:7, 25-26; Jacob 4:11-12; 7:12). This term figures prominently in priestly texts, such as Leviticus, which discuss Israelite sacrificial practices. References to "fatness," (2 Nephi 9:51), "first-fruits" (Jacob 4:11), Abraham’s offering of his son Isaac as a symbol of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God (Jacob 4:5), and the image of garments stained with blood (2 Nephi 9:44; Jacob 1:19), all evoke the sacrifices and offerings of ancient temple worship. This background seems to provide the context for many of Jacob’s teachings. <br><br>
In ancient Israel, the temple represented the presence of God and was considered holy. Jacob uses the divine title "Holy One of Israel" 17 times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. Others who use the title include Nephi (10 times) Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (7 times), Amaleki (2 times), Lehi (2 times), and Zenos (2 times). Significantly, all of these are found in the words of writers on the small plates, except for 3 Nephi 22:5, where Jesus quotes Isaiah. <br><br>
Righteous temple worship demanded ritual purity, and deliberate preparation. Those who were not ritually pure were not allowed to enter. Jacob speaks of the righteous being "clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness" (2 Nephi 9:14), which recalls the whiteness of ancient priestly clothing. He vividly contrasts uncleanliness or filthiness, sin, transgression, and guilt with holiness, purity, and righteousness. Those who are unclean or filthy are cut off from God’s presence, just as the ritually unprepared are shut out from the temple (2 Nephi 9:6, 9). A certain knowledge of God’s holiness and the existence of abominations and wickedness among his own people cause Jacob "to shrink with shame before the presence of [his] Maker" (Jacob 2:6). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Jacob’s language evokes temple symbolism. Jacob’s unshakable faith was nurtured by his service to God throughout his life and his ability to recognize Christ and His plan of mercy in those activities. When we read Jacob’s words, we should ponder how the blessings of the temple can bless us, strengthen us, and increase our hope and love for God and those around us.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Jacob’s Use of Isaiah in 2 Nephi 9-10</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Jacob uses key words from Isaiah to teach the principles of the plan of salvation?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
The prophet Jacob uses Isaiah’s writings in his sermons on the small plates of Nephi to supplement his own inspired teachings (see chart on Jacob’s use of Isaiah). Readers of the Book of Mormon can benefit from a careful comparison of the words found in 2 Nephi 7-8 (Isaiah 50-51; 52:1-2) and 2 Nephi 9-10. <br><br>
Isaiah spoke of the scattering and exile of Israel. Jacob expands upon these ideas by likening those curses to the Fall of Man. Jacob’s text of Isaiah varies from the biblical version. In Jacob’s Isaiah text, the Lord asks, "Have I <b><i>cast thee off</i></b> forever?" (2 Nephi 7:1). The Lord explains that He has not forgotten His people, even though they have transgressed and been scattered. He still has power to deliver and redeem them, when they are willing to answer His call (2 Nephi 7:2).  <br><br>
Jacob describes the Fall and death as having come about through man’s "<b><i>transgression,"</i></b> through which man, like rebellious Israel, was "<b><i>cut off</i></b> from the presence of the Lord," and scattered Israel was cut off from the land of promise (2 Nephi 9:6). Death and the Fall are remedied through the sufferings and death of the Creator Himself, who provided an infinite atonement (2 Nephi 9:5, 7). <br><br>
Isaiah refers to God’s power to dry up the waters (2 Nephi 7:2) and to the Lord’s earlier deliverance of Israel at the Red Sea, where He divided the waters and made a "way for the ransomed to pass over" on dry ground (2 Nephi 8:9-10). The waters are like death, which God has the power to utterly abolish. Just as He made a way for His people to pass through the sea to a new life beyond, so the Lord would die to bring about the resurrection of all mankind.  <br><br>
Jacob reads the promise that "the redeemed of the Lord shall return" (2 Nephi 8:11) in light of the resurrection. This return will be a joyful event for the righteous, while the wicked who die in their sins (since all will be resurrected) shall "return" to God in the judgment, and "behold his face, and remain in their sins" (2 Nephi 9:38), a prospect that will fill them with unspeakable dread and terror (2 Nephi 9:46). <br><br>
Isaiah speaks of the Lord’s righteousness and holiness and invites the Lord’s people to hearken to God’s words. He stresses the impermanence of mortality in the natural world, in contrast to the Lord’s righteousness and holiness, which are forever (2 Nephi 8:6-8, 12-15). Jacob draws upon Isaiah’s language to teach how the redemption of the Holy One of Israel allows His people to share in His righteousness, His holiness, and eternal salvation when they hearken to His words and trust in Him (2 Nephi 9:13-14, 18).  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
A comparison of Isaiah’s words in 2 Nephi 7-8 with the teachings of Jacob in 2 Nephi 9-10 shows that Isaiah’s words were an integral part of Jacob’s sermon. They enabled him to teach the plan of salvation to his people in one of the most remarkable discourses in scriptural literature. When we read Isaiah’s words in 2 Nephi 7-8, we should compare them with Jacob’s subsequent teachings, and ponder how they can increase our understanding of the plan of salvation.
