  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Jacob was Lehi’s fifth son and was born during the family’s difficult wilderness journey to the land of promise. When the family separated after the death of Lehi, Jacob followed his brother Nephi and was consecrated as a priest over Nephi’s people. Nephi recorded some of Jacob’s prophecies on the small plates, and following Nephi’s death, Jacob and his descendants continued to keep the record.</p>

Jacob refers to Christ's role as a creator more than any other Book of Mormon speaker. He uses terms such as "Maker" (2 Nephi 9:40; Jacob 2:6), "great Creator" (2 Nephi 9:5-6; Jacob 3:7), and "all-powerful Creator" (Jacob 2:5). Jacob uses the divine title "Holy One of Israel" 17 times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. Others who use the title include Nephi (10 times), Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (7 times), Amaleki (2 times), Lehi (2 times), and Zenos (2 times). Significantly, all of these titles are found in the words of writers on the small plates, except for 3 Nephi 22:5, where Jesus quotes Isaiah. <br><br>
The phrase "the power of" occurs 17 times in Jacob's writings. It is primarily used in reference to God and His power manifested through His words, the atonement and resurrection, justice, and the Holy Ghost. Only once does it refer to the power of the devil.   <br><br>
Interestingly, among Book of Mormon speakers, Jacob has the second highest number of exclusive words and phrases.  Exclusive words are words that he uses and no other speaker uses.  Only Isaiah in the Book of Mormon has more exclusive words (89), yet Jacob's exclusive words appear at a rate of 85/10,000 words compared to Isaiah's rate of 69/10,000 words.  Although Isaiah's writing style and his message are widely recognized as being unique, Jacob is actually a more unique speaker.  <br><br>
Jacob shows an ability to portray abstract concepts in vivid images. His characterization of death, hell, the devil, and endless torment as an "awful monster" is notable (2 Nephi 9:10, 19, 26). In his temple sermon condemning sin, he speaks of "the piercing eye of the Almighty God" (Jacob 2:10), and reminds the rich and proud that "with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust" (Jacob 2:15). He fears that his words will "enlarge the wounds of those who are already wounded" and will be like "daggers placed to pierce [the] souls and wound [the] delicate minds" of the vulnerable (Jacob 2:9).  <br><br>
Jacob talks more about his feelings than other Book of Mormon speakers. His language often seems more personal and intimate.<sup>1</sup>  In his parting blessing, Lehi indicates that Jacob had been abused and treated harshly by his older brothers, Laman and Lemuel: "And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren" (2 Nephi 2:1). Yet, he had also been blessed with a remarkable testimony of Christ: "And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh" (2 Nephi 2:4).  <br><br>
Jacob's empathy, perhaps gained through his own earlier afflictions, is evident in his words and manifests itself in a reluctance (based on his concern for the vulnerable) to preach harsh messages, even when he must. He feels "weighed down" (Jacob 2:3), it <b><i>grieves him</i></b> (Jacob 2:6-7), and it is a <b><i>burden</i></b> (Jacob 2:9). This language provides a window into his soul. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Jacob's sensitive yet bold personality is evident in his words, a characteristic of his style that sets him apart from other Book of Mormon speakers. When we read about Jacob and study his words, we should ponder how we can be kinder and more sensitive toward others in our teaching, without failing in our duties and responsibilities to God.

<sup>1</sup>  John Tanner, in a study of Jacob's words, observes that "half the [Book of Mormon] citations of 'anxiety' occur in the book of Jacob, and over two-thirds of the references to 'grieve,' 'tender,' and 'shame' (or their derivatives) appear in Jacob's writings. He is the only person to use 'delicate,' 'contempt,' and 'lonesome.' Likewise, only Jacob uses 'wound' to refer to emotional, not physical, injuries, as in the rest of the Book of Mormon. Similarly, he uses 'pierce' or its variants frequently (four of the ten instances) and exclusively in a spiritual sense. Such lexical evidence suggests an author who lives close to his emotions." <br><br>
