  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>King Benjamin was the son of Mosiah I, a righteous king, and a seer who ruled over the land of Zarahemla. His people included those of different cultural backgrounds: the original inhabitants of Zarahemla and Nephites who had migrated to that region under the leadership of his father. In his earlier years, he had personally fought in defense of his people against the Lamanites and was successful in driving them out of the land.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Insights into the Words and phrases</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that King Benjamin is the only Nephite leader to use the word &quot;omnipotent&quot;?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
His words are taken from private teachings to his sons (Mosiah 1:3-7), his son Mosiah II (Mosiah 1:10-14), and his final sermon to his people several years before his death, in which he introduces his son Mosiah II as the new king (Mosiah 2:9-41; 3:1-2; 4:4-30; 5:6-15). Shortly before his sermon, Benjamin was visited by an angel who testified of Christ, and the king included the angel’s message in his words to his people (Mosiah 3:2-27). These words had a remarkable effect upon the people of his day, which was remembered many years later (Helaman 5:9). <br><br>
Apart from the angel (Mosiah 3:5, 17-18, 21), Benjamin is the only Book of Mormon prophet who uses the word "omnipotent" as an attribute of God (Mosiah 5:2, 15). It makes sense that, as a king who was becoming acutely aware of his frailty in his aging years, he would choose to emphasize the incomparable power of God. <br><br>
Other words used exclusively by Benjamin include "render" (3), "attention" (1), "adulterous" (1), "attempting" (1), "injure" (1), "interest" (1), "list" (1), "lively" (1), "peaceably" (1), "prize" (1), "proclaim" (1), "pronounced" (1), "quarrel" (1), "require" (1), "requires" (1), "secondly" (1), "stopped" (1), "trifle" (1), "who ever" (1), and "worthless" (1). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>After rehearsing the words of the angel of God, who taught of the atoning work of the Lord Omnipotent, Benjamin uses the same term for God that had been used by the messenger. The term omnipotent denotes God’s power to do all things according to His will, including His power to bless His children according to their faith and obedience. As we read the words of King Benjamin, we should think of ways to exercise greater faith, so that the Lord may more fully bless us.

      <p>
King Benjamin’s sermon was given at one of the high points of Nephite history (Mosiah 1:11). It is easy to forget that this came after an earlier period of serious difficulty and social conflict. Both Amaleki and Mormon mention that Benjamin witnessed serious contentions and dissensions among his people, early in his reign, and it was only through prolonged and diligent effort that he and other prophets had been able to establish the peace we find at the time of his farewell address (Omni 1:24-25, 27-28; Words of Mormon 1:12-18).  <br><br>
Benjamin solemnly warned his people about future contention and emphasized that such difficulties are inspired and fomented by "the evil spirit" or the devil (Mosiah 2:32-33; 4:14). No doubt based upon experiences from earlier in his reign, Benjamin taught by word and example how humility and gratitude for God’s blessings, which none of us deserve, keep us humble. Continual prayer and service to others also increase our happiness and joy (Mosiah 4:11-12).  <br><br>
Happy parents will not allow their children to engage in contention, but will actively create opportunities for them to serve each other, which will foster love and understanding among family members (Mosiah 4:14-15). This will help them to develop a love of truth and look for opportunities to serve (Mosiah 4:15-16). Benjamin’s act of bestowing upon his people a new name as children of Christ (Mosiah 5:7-12) reinforced this egalitarian teaching, helping people of different cultures and backgrounds (the people of Zarahemla and the Nephites, like people today), to see each other as one people before God. <br><br>
Mormon indicates that the problem of "false Christs," "false prophets, and false preachers and teachers" (Words of Mormon 1:15-16) was associated with the contention and dissensions earlier in Benjamin’s reign. If these false teachers were among those who were seeking to replace Benjamin as the rightful king, then his focus upon Christ as the heavenly king in his final sermon can be seen as a way to correct the erroneous ideas that had contributed to the conflicts of the past. For Benjamin, a proper king, leader, or teacher is one who is unselfish, who does not seek for riches or worldly power, but who unselfishly seeks to uplift and strengthen others and acknowledges, obeys, relies upon, and emulates God, our heavenly king.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Benjamin’s words and example fostered happiness and peace among his people. When we read his teachings, we should seek to understand how those teachings can help us to establish greater happiness in our families and communities today. Benjamin’s words and teachings can help us avoid the traps of false examples of leadership and emulate the pattern set by Jesus Christ.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>King Benjamin and the Poor</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><p class="analysis-intro"><em>Did you know that King Benjamin’s teachings about the poor show us how humility helps us to obtain greater blessings and happiness?</em></p><div class="analysis">
      <p>
A significant focus of King Benjamin’s teachings is our treatment of the poor. He is the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the words "beggar," "beggars," "begged," "supporting," and "dependent." He also is the only one to use the words "borroweth," "lending," and "indebted." It is the poor and needy who most often must borrow from others. This concern for the less fortunate among his people sets Benjamin apart from other leaders who sought for power and gain. <br><br>
Benjamin, however, places the rich and the poor on equal footing by noting that <b><i>all,</i></b> even kings, are beggars indebted to God, an idea that would have seemed surprising to many of the people of his day. Benjamin emphasized that we are all indebted to God, a debt that we are never able to repay (Mosiah 2:21-26). Yet, all that God requires of us is to lend Him our obedience, walk in humility, pray daily, and give according to our means (Mosiah 2:22; 4:11, 24-27).  <br><br>
Benjamin also corrects the erroneous view that one should only help those who deserve it, noting that before God, all are unprofitable servants who receive divine mercy and blessings (Mosiah 4:17-23). This realization and daily remembrance of our lowly and unprofitable state before God schools us in how to approach Him with humble reverence and respect. It helps us to avoid the toxic dangers of pride and selfishness. Benjamin not only speaks of our responsibility to minister to the poor, but also emphasizes the blessings that such service brings to our lives, such as retaining a remission of our sins from day to day (Mosiah 4:12).  <br><br>
As we remember our own unworthiness before God, and remember and seek to bring physical and spiritual relief to those in need (Mosiah 4:11-12), we will "always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God" (Mosiah 4:12), "grow in the knowledge and glory" of God (Mosiah 4:12), and have no desire to injure others (Mosiah 4:13). Only those who serve God as their Master can really know Him (Mosiah 5:13). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>King Benjamin’s words and teachings show how ministering to others increases our happiness and our knowledge of the God who loves us, and helps us to become sanctified. As a righteous and humble king, he pointed his people to Christ. When we read Benjamin’s words, we should try to become more aware of the needs of others and find ways to minister according to our means and ability.
