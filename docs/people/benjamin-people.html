  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>King Benjamin’s speech represents a high point in the righteousness of the people of Nephi and their willingness to receive and apply the teachings of righteous leaders (Mosiah 1:11). During Benjamin’s speech, his people respond in great faith and enter into a covenant to serve God. We have two brief samples of the words of the people, describing their response to the message of the angel who spoke to their king (Mosiah 4:2; 5:2-5).</p>

During his farewell address, Benjamin relates the words of an angel who appeared to him and testified of the coming of Christ and His redemption. The response of the people, as given in the Book of Mormon, incorporates words and phrases from the angel’s message. <br><br>
The angel testified, "For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent . . . <b><i>shall come down from heaven among the children of men"</i></b> (Mosiah 3:5). The angel also said, "And he shall be called <b><i>Jesus Christ, the Son of God,</i></b> the Father of <b><i>heaven and earth,</i></b> the <b><i>Creator</i></b> of all things from the beginning" (Mosiah 3:8). In their response, after hearing the angel’s message, the people affirm, "We believe in <b><i>Jesus Christ, the Son of God,</i></b> who <b><i>created heaven and earth,</i></b> and all things; who <b><i>shall come down among the children of men"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:2). The angel also spoke of "<b><i>the atoning blood of Christ" </i></b>(Mosiah 3:18). The people plead, "O have mercy, and apply <b><i>the atoning blood of Christ"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:2). <br><br>
The angel warned that the wicked who do not repent "have <b><i>drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 3:26). The people enter into a covenant to do God’s will and obey his commandments, "that we may not <b><i>drink out of the cup of the wrath of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:5).  <br><br>
The angel said that Christ would "cast out devils, or the <b><i>evil</i></b> spirits which dwell in the <b><i>hearts</i></b> of the children of men" (Mosiah 3:6). When the people are converted, they respond that the Lord had "wrought a mighty change in . . . our <b><i>hearts,</i></b> that we have no more disposition to do <b><i>evil,</i></b> but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). The gospel of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost had cast the evil from their hearts, just as Jesus would cast out evil spirits. <br><br>
The angel warned that the wicked who rebel against God and do not repent "are consigned to an <b><i>awful view</i></b> of their own guilt and abominations" (Mosiah 3:25). In contrast to the wicked, Benjamin’s people are converted and, through the manifestations of the Spirit, "have <b><i>great views</i></b> of that which is to come" (Mosiah 5:3).

The words of Benjamin’s people, brief as they are, respond to some of the teachings of their king. Benjamin spoke of "<b><i>a never-ending torment"</i></b> (Mosiah 2:39). His people also speak of "<b><i>a never-ending torment,"</i></b> a curse that they earnestly hope to avoid (Mosiah 5:5). <br><br>
Benjamin said that they had come to "<b><i>a knowledge</i></b> of <b><i>the goodness of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:5-6), and also "<b><i>a knowledge</i></b> of the glory of God," which brought them "exceedingly <b><i>great joy"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:11). Benjamin’s people speak of "the infinite <b><i>goodness of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:3), and of having received "great <b><i>knowledge,"</i></b> which brought them "<b><i>great joy"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:4). <br><br>
Benjamin’s people were deeply influenced by the words of the angel and their king. The following phrases are only used by King Benjamin’s people: "apply the atoning blood of Christ," "forgiveness of our sins," "hearts may be purified," "infinite goodness of God," "manifestations of his Spirit," "no more disposition to do evil," "not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God," "the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent," "willing to enter into a covenant," and "wrought a mighty change in us." <br><br>
If, as some have suggested, this speech was given during an Israelite festival, it is possible that the response given by the people was a prepared one, based upon the words and teachings given in the address.<sup>1</sup>  Benjamin clearly hoped that his words would be received positively and was well prepared. Still, the impact of his words upon the people may have been unexpected.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Not everyone responds positively to the message of prophets, even when that message comes from an angel (1 Nephi 3:31; Helaman 13:7, 9; 16:2). Sometimes, however, the power of the Holy Ghost surprises us. The response of Benjamin’s people is remarkable because it shows how a mighty change, one that transforms hearts from evil to good, can occur when a people hearkens to the prophets and acts in humble sincerity and faith. If we hearken to the prophets in our day and act in faith, we can also receive this mighty change of heart.
