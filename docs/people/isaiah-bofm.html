  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Isaiah received his call as a prophet the year the Israelite king Uzziah died. He prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He lived during a time of significant transition in the history of Israel and Judah. He is believed to have been one of the most poetic of Israel’s prophets. Due to the people’s wickedness and unbelief, his teachings were not always heeded or well received.

 During the reign of Hezekiah, the northern kingdom of Israel was destroyed by Assyria and much of the southern kingdom of Judah (Isaiah’s native land) was destroyed as well. Survivors from the Assyrian invasion were carried away into captivity or found refuge at Jerusalem during that time. It was within this environment that Isaiah prophesied concerning the judgments of God upon Israel and other nations and the future gathering of Israel. Later Jewish tradition holds that Isaiah eventually suffered a martyr’s death at the hands of King Manasseh.</p>

      <p>
Isaiah’s favorite nouns are "Zion" and the divine title "the Lord of Hosts," which he uses 29 times, far more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. His favorite adjective is "holy," which he uses 24 times. Significantly, Isaiah has the largest number of unique words of any Book of Mormon speaker. He uses 92 words and phrases that no one else uses. This is a distinctive feature of Isaiah’s style. Isaiah uses the phrase, "it came to pass" (past tense), only twice, but uses "it shall come to pass" 15 times, which is almost seven times more frequently than all the rest of the speakers in the Book of Mormon combined. This is consistent with his focus on prophecy. <br><br>
Isaiah’s emphasis on holiness is significant. He describes his call in Isaiah 6 (2 Nephi 16), when he found himself in the presence of God in the temple and felt overwhelmed by his own lack of holiness. "Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts" (2 Nephi 16:5, Isaiah 6:5). Forgiven of his sins, he was able to fulfill his prophetic call, but his emphasis on holiness throughout his prophecies shows an acute awareness of the dramatic contrast between human (and Israel’s) fallen nature and the holiness of God, a contrast that he had experienced firsthand.  <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>The earnest hope for Zion’s future redemption, purification, and eventual glorification runs like a golden thread throughout Isaiah’s words. Isaiah’s words teach us that God wants to raise us above our fallen natures, heal our wounds, and clothe us with royal glory and holiness, but we must be willing to hear and receive Him.
