  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Abinadi was a prophet who preached about the coming of Christ to King Noah and his people, and was put to death for it (Mosiah 11-17). He taught that redemption from sin and death comes through the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Abinadi’s teachings were recorded by Alma I, who had been a priest of King Noah, but was converted by Abinadi’s testimony (Mosiah 17:4).</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Abinadi</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><h3 class="subheading">Did you know that Abinadi is the only Book of Mormon prophet to use the title &quot;Founder of Peace&quot; for Christ?</h3><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Redemption is an important theme in Abinadi’s teaching. He uses variants of the word "redeem" more than any other Book of Mormon speaker. These include "redeem" (Mosiah 13:33; 15:1, 11-12, 27), "redeemeth" (Mosiah 15:26; 16:2), "redemption" (Mosiah 13:32; 15:19; 16:5-6, 15), and speaks of those who are "redeemed" (Mosiah 15:9, 18, 23-24, 27, 30; 16:4). <br><br>
The phrase "the bands of death" is statistically significant for Abinadi. He is 70.8% more likely to use the term than any other Book of Mormon speaker. It is possible that some of Abinadi’s resurrection teaching draws upon Isaiah’s reference to Zion, being told to "arise" from the dust, having her "bands" removed, and being clothed in glorious apparel (Isaiah 52:1-2). He uses the phrase, "I say unto you" eight times more than every other Book of Mormon speaker combined.<br><br>
Words uniquely used by Abinadi include "beguile" (1), "cuts" (1), "disowned" (1), "endlessly" (1), "gnash" (1), "persists" (1), "goes" (1), "pretend" (1), "works whether they be good or whether they be evil" (1), and "he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin" (1).<br><br>
Abinadi uses the titles "Eternal Father" (Mosiah 16:15) and "Eternal Father of heaven and earth" (Mosiah 15:4), as do several other Book of Mormon prophets; but his reference to Christ as "the <b><i>very</i></b> Eternal Father" (Mosiah 15:4) is unique. <br><br>
Abinadi is also the only Book of Mormon speaker to use the title, "Founder of Peace" (Mosiah 15:18). It is interesting to consider the possibility that the title might be a wordplay upon the name Jerusalem, which appears in the passage Noah’s priests ask Abinadi to interpret (Isaiah 52:9; Mosiah 12:23). While there is uncertainty among scholars as to the precise meaning of the name, some have interpreted it to mean something like "foundation of peace." <sup>1</sup> <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Abinadi’s teaching that Christ is the founder of peace is significant. It highlights how our Redeemer is the only foundation upon which lasting peace can be built. As we read the words of Abinadi, we should ponder his message and testimony of Christ, and how Christ’s saving work and the blessing of repentance can bring greater peace and happiness to our lives.
