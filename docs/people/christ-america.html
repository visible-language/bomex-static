  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>For the people of Nephi in the land of promise, the Savior’s manifestation to them, after His death and His appearance in glory following His resurrection from the dead, was a transformative event. At the beginning of the thirty-fourth year after the sign of Jesus’ birth had been given, there was great destruction among the wicked, followed by three days of darkness. It was during this time of darkness that Jesus Christ announced the scope of the destruction that had occurred, identified Himself as the Creator and Redeemer, and invited those who had not been destroyed to repent and receive Him (3 Nephi 9:1-22; 10:3-7). 

Later, at the end of that same year, while the people were gathered at a temple in the land of Bountiful, Jesus descended from heaven and taught the people for a period of three days (3 Nephi 11-26). He continued to visit them from time to time thereafter during this time of righteousness (3 Nephi 26-28). Many of the words He spoke to the people during this visitation were recorded, including those that Mormon was permitted to inscribe in the Book of Mormon (3 Nephi 26:6-11).</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Did you know that Jesus’ favorite noun is &quot;Father&quot;?</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Only two speakers in the Book of Mormon refer to "Heavenly Father;" Jesus does so three of these four times. Jesus’ favorite noun is "Father," which He uses 149 times. This is appropriate, given Jesus’ teaching that He and the Father are one in testimony, doctrine, and will. It also points to the closeness of His relationship with Heavenly Father. <br><br>
His favorite verb is "be," which He uses over 200 times in the text. The resurrected Jesus’ favorite adverb is "verily." He uses the phrase, "Verily, I say," 21 times and for emphasis, He doubles it, saying "Verily, verily, I say," 23 times. The word "verily," used so often by the Savior, underscores the truth of His words. He is the only speaker in the text who uses the phrases "build upon my Gospel," "my flesh and blood," "this is my doctrine," "upon my rock," and "come unto me and be baptized in my name."<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Jesus’ use of the verb "be" is notable because it constitutes a command to all those who desire to follow Him. It is both a command and an invitation to follow Him in the way of righteousness and happiness in order to become even as He is ("even as I am," 3 Nephi 27:27). The Savior’s laser-like focus on what we can <b><i>be</i></b> through Him and His love and redeeming power, not on what we <b><i>have been,</i></b> constitutes the very essence of our hope as disciples of Jesus Christ. We should look to the future, not to the failures of the past.
