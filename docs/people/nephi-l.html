  <p><em>Circa 615 B.C.-540 B.C.</em></p>
  <h2>Brief biography</h2>
  <p>Nephi was the fourth son of Lehi and Sariah, and the brother of Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Jacob, and Joseph. His belief and support of the Lord’s revelations to his father and his determination to be obedient to God often brought him into conflict with his two oldest brothers during their journey to the land of promise. He was the recipient of many visions and revelations of his own. 

After the death of Lehi, the family divided, and those who were willing to hearken to the commandments of God followed Nephi and became his people. He was both a religious and a political leader. Nephi’s words on the small plates (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi) contain an account of his family’s journey through the wilderness, and some of his visions, prophecies, and teachings.</p>
  <p>Total recorded words -- 27366</p>

Surprisingly, it is Nephi, rather than Lehi, who first uses the name Jesus Christ, a name that is revealed to him by an angel (1 Nephi 12:18, original manuscript; 2 Nephi 25:19). Like his younger brother Jacob, who shares his appreciation for the writings of Isaiah, Nephi frequently uses the title "Holy One of Israel" (10 times). Among Book of Mormon speakers, this title is only used by prophets on the small plates.<br><br>
In the introduction to the account of his own visions, Nephi cites a prophecy of his father concerning the baptism of the "Lamb of God" (1 Nephi 10:10). Nephi’s questions about his father’s teachings led to a vision of his own, where an angel showed him the Lamb’s future mission (1 Nephi 11-14). Aside from the angel himself, Nephi references Christ as the "Lamb" or "Lamb of God" more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon text (more than 22 times). Compare this to Moroni (5 times), Alma (twice), Amulek (once), and Mormon (once). <br><br>
The revelations Nephi received figure significantly in his writings. Nephi uses the adjective great most frequently to refer to "great things," almost always in reference to things that are revealed or done by God, as well as what he has personally witnessed. <br><br>
In addition to the teachings of his father and his own revelations from God, Nephi seems to have been greatly influenced by the records on the plates of brass. He speaks of his delight in the scriptures and in using them to persuade others to believe in Christ and his mission (2 Nephi 4:15-16; 11:4). He has a particular preference and love for Isaiah’s prophecies, although the writings of Moses, Zenos, Zenock, and Neum are also specifically mentioned (1 Nephi 19:10-23).

<p> 
In contrast to other writers, Nephi has a marked preference for the words "my father" (99), "beheld" (77), "angel" (45), "my brethren" (62), and "plates" (52). While Nephi refers to the Lamanites, unlike subsequent writers, he never uses the term "Nephites" to refer to his own people as later writers do, but always refers to them as "my people." <br><br>
Among writers and speakers in the Book of Mormon, he alone uses the phrases "the seed of my brethren" (12), "representation" (5), "the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass" (4), "the remnant of our seed" (4), and "treasury" (4). The phrase "wars and rumors of wars" (4) is used exclusively by Nephi.
<br><br>
Nephi’s preference for "plainness" (2 Nephi 31:3) underscores his bold, uncompromising, and forthright style. His closing words sound a triumphant tone: "I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell." He optimistically looks forward to meeting many souls who are spotless before the judgment seat of God (2 Nephi 33:6-7). As one writer has observed, "Nephi’s farewell strikes a dominant chord and is accompanied by timpani rolls and cymbal clashes," in contrast to his brother Jacob, who "ends quietly and in a minor key."  While both Nephi and Jacob speak boldly, Nephi seems less concerned with offending the sensibilities of others.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Nephi’s words point to key influences in his life---things revealed to him by God, sacred scriptures, and his family. When we read Nephi’s words, we should ponder how a greater appreciation for the revelations the Lord provides in our own lives, through the gift of the Holy Ghost and the scriptures, can allow us to be blessed in greater measure, like Nephi and his family.<br><br>

Laman and Lemuel complained that they had suffered in the wilderness "because we would <b><i>hearken</i></b> unto his [Father Lehi’s] <b><i>words."</i></b> They also asserted that the people of the land of Jerusalem were a righteous people and that their father had misjudged them (1 Nephi 17:22).  <br><br>
Nephi uses the theme of the divine word to teach his brothers the blessings of hearkening to the words of God through ancient prophets. Their Israelite ancestors would have remained in miserable bondage had they not "<b><i>hearkened</i></b> unto the <b><i>words</i></b> of the Lord," through Moses (1 Nephi 17:23). They were led through the sea by "<b><i>his</i></b> [Moses’] <b><i>word"</i></b> (1 Nephi 17:26).  <br><br>
Miracles were accomplished and mortals were preserved through obedience to the word (1 Nephi 17:29). Rough places were made smooth, smooth places were broken up, and the earth itself would pass away through God’s word (1 Nephi 17:46). "According to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did destroy them; and according to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did lead them; and according to <b><i>his word</i></b> he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by <b><i>his word"</i></b> (1 Nephi 17:31). Nephi taught his brothers that the righteous are those who hearken to the word (1 Nephi 17:38). The wicked reject "every word of God" (1 Nephi 17:35) and can become so insensitive that they "[can]not feel his words" (1 Nephi 17:45). Nephi uses "word" or "words" 11 times in his response to his brothers. <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>When his brothers complained that they were unhappy because they had hearkened to Lehi’s words in leaving Jerusalem, Nephi reminded them that all blessings come from hearkening to the Lord’s words. The greatest happiness in life comes when we diligently hearken to (in other words, follow) the words of the Lord. As we read Nephi’s words to his brothers, we should ponder how greater obedience to the Lord’s teachings through the prophets can bring us greater happiness.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Leading Words</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Nephi’s brothers complained that their father Lehi was "<b><i>led away</i></b> by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath <b><i>led us out</i></b> of the land of Jerusalem" (1 Nephi 17:20). They also said that their father had "<b><i>led us away</i></b> because we would hearken to his words" (1 Nephi 17:22). In his defense of the Lord and his father’s prophetic leadership, Nephi uses his brothers’ language to review their Israelite past. <br><br>
Nephi notes that the children of Israel were "<b><i>led out</i></b> of bondage," which was a good thing (1 Nephi 17:24-25). They were also led through the wilderness (1 Nephi 17:30), showing that the Lord "<b><i>leadeth away</i></b> the righteous into precious lands" (1 Nephi 17:38). Nephi uses phrases with the word "led" or "lead" ("led away out," "lead them out," "led," "leading," "lead them," "leadeth away," and "led forth") eight times in his response to his brothers. He does so to draw an implicit comparison to the experiences of their own family, who were led by the Lord and the prophet Lehi.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Nephi uses his brothers’ own vocabulary to rebut their accusations and to teach them how the past experiences of their ancestors were remarkably like their own, and that the Lord was just as concerned with them as He had been with the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness. As we read Nephi’s words, we should remember that the Lord cares just as much about us as He did about His people in the past. When we see ourselves as continuing the story of God’s work with His covenant people, we can gain a clearer perspective on how we should act from day to day.

<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Nephi’s Defense in 1 Nephi 17</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
When Nephi began to build a ship, as commanded by the Lord, his brothers Laman and Lemuel claimed that Nephi lacked the ability to perform such a task (1 Nephi 17:17). They then launched into a complaint over their perceived wrongs, for which they held Nephi and his father responsible (1 Nephi 17:19-22). Nephi’s lengthy response is interesting because he draws upon several words and ideas expressed in that complaint to teach, testify, and defend the prophetic calling of his father Lehi (1 Nephi 17: 23-51). Several examples of this can be seen in Nephi’s use of the words, "ye know," "led" or "lead," and his teachings relating to the need to "hearken" to the "word" or "words" of God (See <i>Ye Know</i>, <i>Leading Words</i>, and <i>Hearkening to the Word in this directory</i>). <br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Nephi shows how God teaches His word and blesses His children through His appointed prophets. His words also show how great teachers can build faith by reminding others of what they already know, or knew but may have forgotten.

Laman and Lemuel use the words "we knew" when they assert Nephi’s lack of abilities (1 Nephi 17:19). They also use to the words "we know" when they assert that the people of Jerusalem were a righteous people, wrongly judged by their father (1 Nephi 17:22). Nephi responds to his brothers by reminding them what they know. "<b><i>Ye know</i></b> that the children of Israel were in bondage; and <b><i>ye know</i></b> that they were laden with tasks, which were grievous to be borne; wherefore, <b><i>ye know</i></b> that it must needs be a good thing for them, that they should be brought out of bondage" (1 Nephi 17:25). He also reminds them of Moses’ divine call, which was much like their father’s. "<b><i>Ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord" (1 Nephi 17:26). He also uses the words <b><i>"ye know"</i></b> to remind them of the miracles God performed through Moses (1 Nephi 17:26-29, 42). Nephi uses the phrases <b><i>"ye know"</i></b> and <b><i>"ye also know"</i></b> eleven times in his defense. <br><br>
When speaking of his own knowledge, Nephi says, "I know not but they [the people at Jerusalem] are at this day about to be destroyed," but then testifies that "<b><i>I know</i></b> that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed" (1 Nephi 17:43). Unlike his brothers, who say they know things that are really false, Nephi testifies only to what he does actually know. By reminding his brothers of the past experiences of their ancestors, something no Israelite would deny, Nephi is able to draw a parallel with their own family experiences in the wilderness and defend their father’s prophetic leadership.<br><br></p><h4 class="analysis-heading">Suggested application</h4><p>Nephi used the very words spoken by his brothers to remind them of what they already knew about their past, to encourage them to be more faithful. When we read Nephi’s words responding to the criticisms of his brothers, we should ponder what we can do to remember the great things the Lord has done for each of us in the past, to encourage us to be more obedient in the future.
