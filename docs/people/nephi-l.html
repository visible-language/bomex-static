  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Nephi was the fourth son of Lehi and Sariah, and the brother of Laman, Lemuel, Sam, Jacob, and Joseph. His belief and support of the Lord’s revelations to his father and his determination to be obedient to God often brought him into conflict with his two oldest brothers during their journey to the land of promise. He was the recipient of many visions and revelations of his own. 

After the death of Lehi, the family divided, and those who were willing to hearken to the commandments of God followed Nephi and became his people. He was both a religious and a political leader. Nephi’s words on the small plates (1 Nephi and 2 Nephi) contain an account of his family’s journey through the wilderness, and some of his visions, prophecies, and teachings.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Did you know that Nephi uses the title &quot;Lamb of God&quot; for Christ more than any other Nephite prophet?</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Surprisingly, it is Nephi, rather than Lehi, who first uses the name Jesus Christ, a name that is revealed to him by an angel (1 Nephi 12:18, original manuscript; 2 Nephi 25:19). Like his younger brother Jacob, who shares his appreciation for the writings of Isaiah, Nephi frequently uses the title "Holy One of Israel" (10 times). Among Book of Mormon speakers, this title is only used by prophets on the small plates.<br><br>
In the introduction to the account of his own visions, Nephi cites a prophecy of his father concerning the baptism of the "Lamb of God" (1 Nephi 10:10). Nephi’s questions about his father’s teachings led to a vision of his own, where an angel showed him the Lamb’s future mission (1 Nephi 11-14). Aside from the angel himself, Nephi references Christ as the "Lamb" or "Lamb of God" more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon text (more than 22 times). Compare this to Moroni (5 times), Alma (twice), Amulek (once), and Mormon (once). <br><br>
The revelations Nephi received figure significantly in his writings. Nephi uses the adjective great most frequently to refer to "great things," almost always in reference to things that are revealed or done by God, as well as what he has personally witnessed. <br><br>
In addition to the teachings of his father and his own revelations from God, Nephi seems to have been greatly influenced by the records on the plates of brass. He speaks of his delight in the scriptures and in using them to persuade others to believe in Christ and his mission (2 Nephi 4:15-16; 11:4). He has a particular preference and love for Isaiah’s prophecies, although the writings of Moses, Zenos, Zenock, and Neum are also specifically mentioned (1 Nephi 19:10-23).

<p> 
In contrast to other writers, Nephi has a marked preference for the words "my father" (99), "beheld" (77), "angel" (45), "my brethren" (62), and "plates" (52). While Nephi refers to the Lamanites, unlike subsequent writers, he never uses the term "Nephites" to refer to his own people as later writers do, but always refers to them as "my people." <br><br>
Among writers and speakers in the Book of Mormon, he alone uses the phrases "the seed of my brethren" (12), "representation" (5), "the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass" (4), "the remnant of our seed" (4), and "treasury" (4). The phrase "wars and rumors of wars" (4) is used exclusively by Nephi.
<br><br>
Nephi’s preference for "plainness" (2 Nephi 31:3) underscores his bold, uncompromising, and forthright style. His closing words sound a triumphant tone: "I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell." He optimistically looks forward to meeting many souls who are spotless before the judgment seat of God (2 Nephi 33:6-7). As one writer has observed, "Nephi’s farewell strikes a dominant chord and is accompanied by timpani rolls and cymbal clashes," in contrast to his brother Jacob, who "ends quietly and in a minor key."  While both Nephi and Jacob speak boldly, Nephi seems less concerned with offending the sensibilities of others.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Nephi’s words point to key influences in his life---things revealed to him by God, sacred scriptures, and his family. When we read Nephi’s words, we should ponder how a greater appreciation for the revelations the Lord provides in our own lives, through the gift of the Holy Ghost and the scriptures, can allow us to be blessed in greater measure, like Nephi and his family.<br><br>
