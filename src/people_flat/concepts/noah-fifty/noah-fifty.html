In his words to his brothers, following an encounter with Laban, Nephi compared the powerful official and his servants to Pharaoh and the Egyptian armies. Nephi’s brothers complained that Laban could command fifty soldiers, who could easily slay them. "How is it possible," they wondered, "that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command <b><i>fifty,</i></b> yea, even he can slay <b><i>fifty;</i></b> then why not us?" (1 Nephi 3:31). 
<br><br>
Nephi then reminded his brothers of the Lord’s power. "Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his <b><i>fifty, yea, or even than his <b><i>tens of thousands?"</i></b> (1 Nephi 4:1).
<br><br>
Nephi recalled how the Egyptian armies who pursued and sought to slay the children of Israel were drowned in the Red Sea. "The Lord is able to <b><i>deliver us,</i></b> even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians" (1 Nephi 4:1-3).
