The term "Great Spirit" appears 18 times in the Book of Mormon, but not once in the Bible. When told of Ammon's exploits in protecting the king's flocks, King Lamoni thought, "Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the <b><i>Great Spirit</i></b> who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?" (Alma 18:2). Mormon explained, "Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received of his father, that there was a <b><i>Great Spirit</i></b>. Notwithstanding they believed in a <b><i>Great Spirit</i></b>, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right" (Alma 18:5). When Ammon first began teaching Lamoni, he asked if Lamoni believed in God. Lamoni said that that he did not understand. Then, Ammon said, "Believest thou that there is a <b><i>Great Spirit</i></b>? And he said, Yea. And Ammon said: <b><i>This is God"</i></b> (Alma 18:24-28).
