Nephi observes how the ball or Liahona shows how the Lord can make use of small things  
to accomplish great things (1 Nephi 16:2). He uses the Lord’s blessings upon his  
family in the wilderness to show how the Lord succors, strengthens, and prospers those  
who keep his commandments (1 Nephi 17:3). In his account of the destruction of the  
Jaredites, Moroni observes how the wickedness and abominations of a people prepare the  
way for their destruction (Ether 14:25). <br><br>
Mormon stands out as the speaker who uses the phrase most. He never uses it in a  
doctrinal discussion, as do Alma and Antionah; rather, his usage is similar to Nephi  
and his son Moroni, although their usage is less frequent. <br><br>
When we examine the use of the phrase by Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni, we can see how the  
phrase "and thus we see" is like a laser pen that points to important lessons that  
Book of Mormon speakers want the reader to glean from their narrative. <br><br>
<b>1 Nephi 16:28-29</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the pointers which  
were in the ball, that they did work according to the faith and diligence and heed  
which we did give unto them. <br><br>
And there was also written upon them a new writing, which was plain to be read, which  
did give us understanding concerning the ways of the Lord; and it was written and  
changed from time to time, according to the faith and diligence which we gave unto it.  
<b>And thus we see</b> that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.  
</i></p><br>
Nephi describes his family’s experience with the Liahona, which provided directions on  
their journey through the wilderness. Although the ball was a gift from the Lord, it  
functioned well enough that the family may have come to take it for granted. The words  
and their changing messages were something new and surprising. The Lord took what had  
at first seemed to be a rather simple instrument and used it to provide miraculous  
changing instructions suitable to their circumstances. Lehi’s family only prospered on  
their journey to the extent that they were diligent and faithful in following the  
instructions and commandments of God. Nephi shows us that the Lord can use fairly  
simple things as a way to teach us new and useful things, if we are diligent and  
obedient. <br><br>
<b>1 Nephi 17:3 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> that the commandments of God must be  
fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he  
doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish  
the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we  
did sojourn in the wilderness. </i></p><br>
Nephi tells us that during the most difficult part of their journey, the Lord blessed  
them with the resources and help they needed to be obedient and successful. The  
message is that obedience to God’s commandments brings additional power, even during  
the hardest of times. <br><br>
<b>Alma 24:19 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> that, when these Lamanites were brought  
to believe and to know the truth, they were firm and would suffer even unto death  
rather than commit sin; <b>and thus we see</b> that they buried their weapons of  
peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace. </i></p><br>
The firmness of the Lamanite converts was remarkable because it realized the hopes of  
their ancestral father Lehi, which were not fulfilled in Laman and Lemuel. Later, when  
the Church of God was broken up due to wickedness, one of the few bright spots was the  
faithfulness of such converts. Mormon speaks of "<i>a few of the Lamanites who were  
converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were  
<b>firm and steadfast, and immovable,</b> willing with all diligence to keep the  
commandments of the Lord"</i> (3 Nephi 6:14), which was precisely what Lehi had hoped  
for with his eldest sons (1 Nephi 2:10).  <br><br>
Mormon observes that the key was that they were brought to "believe" through the good  
examples and selfless love and sacrifices of Ammon and his brethren. By acting in  
faith upon the Lord’s words, they were able to know these things for themselves,  
providing a secure foundation for their remarkable stability. <br><br>
<b>Alma 24:27 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were  
more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; <b>thus we see</b> that  
the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people. </i></p><br>
Mormon relates the martyrdom of more than a thousand Lamanites converts by  
unbelievers. In the aftermath, many Lamanites who had been involved were deeply  
penitent and were converted; their number exceeded the number who had been slain.  
Mormon also emphasizes that those who were killed had all been righteous and were not  
lost. Mormon’s purpose is to show how the Lord can miraculously accomplish his divine  
purposes and change hearts, even in the face of terrible and traumatic events.  
<br><br>
<b>Alma 28:13-14</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> how great the inequality of man is  
because of sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the  
cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.  <br><br>
<b>And thus we see</b> the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of  
the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing---sorrow  
because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ  
unto life.</i></p><br>
Mormon was fully aware of the inequality that existed in society, but emphasized that  
the greatest inequality of all was when people inflicted needless sorrow and misery  
upon themselves by yielding to sin and refusing to turn to Christ. Sharing the gospel  
in our day is just as important as it was for the people of Lehi. <br><br>
<b>Alma 30:60</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> the end of him who perverteth the ways of  
the Lord; <b>and thus we see </b>that the devil will not support his children at the  
last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell. </i></p><br>
The example of Korihor shows that the devil ultimately abandons those who serve and  
follow him to misery and destruction, a stark contrast to the Lord, who offers eternal  
mercies and blessings to those who place their trust in Him.  <br><br>
<b>Alma 46:8-10 </b><br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>Thus we see</b> how quick the children of men do forget the  
Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity and to be led away by the evil one.   
<br><br>
Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place  
among the children of men.  <br><br>
Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many  
flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and  
to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which  
God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land  
for the righteous’ sake. </i></p><br>
Mormon emphasizes how easily and quickly the unguarded can fall from grace and be led  
to destruction by the worldly wicked, who are often skilled and influential. Captain  
Moroni’s response to this serious threat shows how it is sometimes necessary to rally  
the righteous against such influences and provide ways to remind each of us of the  
power and mercies of God; otherwise, we can be seduced by the flattery of unrighteous  
influencers. <br><br>
<b>Alma 50:19-23</b> <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i><b>And thus we see</b> how merciful and just are all the  
dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men;  
yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto  
Lehi, saying: <br><br>
Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall  
keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they  
will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.  
<br><br>
And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has  
been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their  
plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among  
themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.  <br><br>
And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at  
all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage,  
or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites. 
But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of  
Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first  
year of the reign of the judges.</i></p><br>
Mormon’s "thus we see" emphasizes that the Lord always keeps His promises. When they  
kept the Lord’s commandments, the people of Nephi were blessed with the means to  
protect themselves from deadly enemies, but cursed when they permitted wickedness to  
grow and fester in their society. It is notable that, although this was a time of war,  
Mormon considered it one of the happiest periods of Nephite history because the people  
faithfully kept the Lord’s commandments. As we read the Book of Mormon today, it is  
important to remember that the Lord is the same today and will bless us when we  
remember and keep his commandments.
