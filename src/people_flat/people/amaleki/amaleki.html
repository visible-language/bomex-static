The word "ministering" is only used seven times in the Book of Mormon. One of those times is by Amaleki, even though he only contributes 895 words to the text. Amaleki is the last Nephite writer to use the title "Holy One of Israel," a title that is only used by writers on the small plates. Only Amaleki uses the words "preachings," "severity," and "moons." This last word refers to the time Coriantumr spent among the people of Zarahemla before he died. The people of Zarahemla came from Judah, where a lunar calendar was used.<br><br>
Amaleki wrote of a significant transitional time in Nephite history when the Nephites, for unspecified reasons, had to leave the land of Nephi and resettle in a new location in the midst of a new people. Perhaps to underscore that such an event was inspired by God, he presents Mosiah’s actions as similar to those of Nephi, who also led a group of faithful people from an earlier land of inheritance to a new location. <br><br>
Mosiah, like Nephi, was <i>warned</i> to "flee" out the land with all who would "hearken" to prophetic revelation (2 Nephi 5:5-6; Omni 1:12). They fled "into the wilderness" (2 Nephi 5:5; Omni 1:12), where they each found a new land (2 Nephi 5:7-8; Omni 1:13). Both Nephi and Mosiah carried records with them, specifically, the "plates of brass" (2 Nephi 5:12; Omni 1:14). Each leader was a teacher in this new setting. Nephi taught his people building skills (2 Nephi 5:15), while Mosiah taught the people of Zarahemla the language of the Nephites (Omni 1:18). Each was appointed a leader in the new setting (2 Nephi 5:15; Omni 1:19). <br><br>
Amaleki uses the phrase, "the voice of the Lord," at a higher rate than the rest of the Book of Mormon. The phrase is used in recounting Mosiah’s leadership of the Nephites out of the land of Nephi and reinforces the idea that this was done under divine direction. <br><br>
Some of the Nephites may not have been happy with Mosiah’s leadership. Benjamin mentioned contentions during the reign of his father (Mosiah 2:32-33). At least one significant group departed from Zarahemla and returned to the land of Nephi; it included Amaleki’s brother (Omni 1:27-30). Amaleki may have wished to compare Mosiah to Nephi to reinforce the divine legitimacy of Mosiah’s leadership. His leadership was inspired by God, as was Nephi’s.
