While both Moroni 9 and the abridged material in Mormon 1-6 were written by Mormon, the letter is a contemporary expression by Mormon, while the abridged material is his later brief summary and commentary about his people’s fall over 62 years. Since the letters were written first and the abridgment later, words and themes in the letter that also appear in Mormon 1-6 help the reader to date the events in Moroni 9. <br><br>
Mormon uses the words "horrible scene" in both Mormon 4:11 and Moroni 9:20. These are the only references to these words in the Book of Mormon, and both are used by Mormon. When Mormon describes the state of bloodshed and evil among his people, he says it "doth exceed everything; yea, <b><i>tongue</i></b> cannot tell, neither can it be <b><i>written</i></b>" (Moroni 9:19). He uses similar language in speaking of the Nephites. "And it is impossible for the <b><i>tongue</i></b> to describe, or for man to <b><i>write</i></b> a perfect description" (Mormon 4:11). <br><br>
Mormon laments his people’s wickedness, noting that "only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a <b><i>delightsome people</i></b>" (Moroni 9:12). In Mormon 5:17, just before he describes the events at the hill Cumorah, Mormon says, "they were once a <b><i>delightsome people</i></b>" (Mormon 5:17). In both letters to his son, Mormon expresses the concern, "I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them" (Moroni 8:28; 9:4). In Mormon 5:16, he expresses this as an accomplished fact: "For behold, the Spirit of the Lord hath already ceased to strive" with them (Mormon 5:16).  <br><br>
Mormon was forbidden to preach to his people until A.D. 350 (Mormon 1:16-17; 3:2-3). He did not resume command over the Nephite armies until around A.D. 375. In his letter, he refers both to his preaching and his work as commander (Moroni 9:2, 4, 18). These factors, and the similar wording found in both his letter to Moroni and his abridgment in Mormon 4-5, suggest that the letter and the abridged material were written close to the same time.
