Certain words used by Mormon often differ in meaning from how they are used by other Book of Mormon speakers. One study found that he "uses <i>command</i> to mean `leadership’ and is completely unique in this usage. Second, most of these uses are secular in nature; i.e., secular leaders give various commands. The exception to this is when Mormon is not editing and speaks for himself---in that case, the Lord commands." <sup>1</sup><br><br>
Mormon’s use of the word "earth" is also significant. Nephi tends to speak of the earth theologically or in broad cosmic terms. God’s power can cause the earth to pass away (1 Nephi 17:46). The seed of Joseph will not perish as long as the earth shall stand (2 Nephi 25:21-22). What he seals on earth shall be sealed in heaven (2 Nephi 33:15). In contrast to Nephi, Mormon’s use of earth tends to be more local and usually refers to the ground. <sup>2</sup><br><br>
