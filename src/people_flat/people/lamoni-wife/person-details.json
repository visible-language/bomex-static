  "description": "This Lamanite queen lived around 90 B.C. in the land of Ishmael. King Lamoni’s wife is described as a woman of great faith; her faith, according to the missionary prophet Ammon, exceeded that of the Nephites (Alma 19:10). When her husband fell to the earth and was unconscious for days, some of her servants tried to persuade her that he was dead and should be buried (Alma 19:5). Hearing that Ammon was a prophet, she sought his counsel. He promised her that the king was not dead, but would rise on the morrow (Alma 19:8). When the king indeed rose again, she too was overcome by the Spirit and received a testimony of Christ’s redemption.",
