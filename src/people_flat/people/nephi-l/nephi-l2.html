In contrast to other writers, Nephi has a marked preference for the words "my father" (99), "beheld" (77), "angel" (45), "my brethren" (62), and "plates" (52). While Nephi refers to the Lamanites, unlike subsequent writers, he never uses the term "Nephites" to refer to his own people as later writers do, but always refers to them as "my people." <br><br>
Among writers and speakers in the Book of Mormon, he alone uses the phrases "the seed of my brethren" (12), "representation" (5), "the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass" (4), "the remnant of our seed" (4), and "treasury" (4). The phrase "wars and rumors of wars" (4) is used exclusively by Nephi.

Nephi’s preference for "plainness" (2 Nephi 31:3) underscores his bold, uncompromising, and forthright style. His closing words sound a triumphant tone: "I glory in plainness; I glory in truth; I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul from hell." He optimistically looks forward to meeting many souls who are spotless before the judgment seat of God (2 Nephi 33:6-7). As one writer has observed, "Nephi’s farewell strikes a dominant chord and is accompanied by timpani rolls and cymbal clashes," in contrast to his brother Jacob, who "ends quietly and in a minor key."  While both Nephi and Jacob speak boldly, Nephi seems less concerned with offending the sensibilities of others.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Nephi’s words point to key influences in his life---things revealed to him by God, sacred scriptures, and his family. When we read Nephi’s words, we should ponder how a greater appreciation for the revelations the Lord provides in our own lives, through the gift of the Holy Ghost and the scriptures, can allow us to be blessed in greater measure, like Nephi and his family.<br><br>
