When Nephi began to build a ship, as commanded by the Lord, his brothers Laman and Lemuel claimed that Nephi lacked the ability to perform such a task (1 Nephi 17:17). They then launched into a complaint over their perceived wrongs, for which they held Nephi and his father responsible (1 Nephi 17:19-22). Nephi’s lengthy response is interesting because he draws upon several words and ideas expressed in that complaint to teach, testify, and defend the prophetic calling of his father Lehi (1 Nephi 17: 23-51). Several examples of this can be seen in Nephi’s use of the words, "ye know," "led" or "lead," and his teachings relating to the need to "hearken" to the "word" or "words" of God (See <i>Ye Know</i>, <i>Leading Words</i>, and <i>Hearkening to the Word in this directory</i>). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Nephi shows how God teaches His word and blesses His children through His appointed prophets. His words also show how great teachers can build faith by reminding others of what they already know, or knew but may have forgotten.
