Nephi’s brothers complained that their father Lehi was "<b><i>led away</i></b> by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath <b><i>led us out</i></b> of the land of Jerusalem" (1 Nephi 17:20). They also said that their father had "<b><i>led us away</i></b> because we would hearken to his words" (1 Nephi 17:22). In his defense of the Lord and his father’s prophetic leadership, Nephi uses his brothers’ language to review their Israelite past. <br><br>
Nephi notes that the children of Israel were "<b><i>led out</i></b> of bondage," which was a good thing (1 Nephi 17:24-25). They were also led through the wilderness (1 Nephi 17:30), showing that the Lord "<b><i>leadeth away</i></b> the righteous into precious lands" (1 Nephi 17:38). Nephi uses phrases with the word "led" or "lead" ("led away out," "lead them out," "led," "leading," "lead them," "leadeth away," and "led forth") eight times in his response to his brothers. He does so to draw an implicit comparison to the experiences of their own family, who were led by the Lord and the prophet Lehi.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Nephi uses his brothers’ own vocabulary to rebut their accusations and to teach them how the past experiences of their ancestors were remarkably like their own, and that the Lord was just as concerned with them as He had been with the children of Israel when they were in the wilderness. As we read Nephi’s words, we should remember that the Lord cares just as much about us as He did about His people in the past. When we see ourselves as continuing the story of God’s work with His covenant people, we can gain a clearer perspective on how we should act from day to day.
