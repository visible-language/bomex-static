The phrase, "stand fast in [the] liberty wherewith God hath made [us] free," was first used by Alma I in the land of Helam, when his people wanted to make him a king. <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.  <br><br>
And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye <b>should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free,</b> and that ye trust no man to be a king over you </i>(Mosiah 23:12-13).</p>  <br>
This teaching is also used by Helaman the son of Alma II and the Nephite chief judge, Pahoran. The phrase is rooted in the idea that kings and unrighteous leaders will lead their people into iniquity. King Mosiah’s abandonment of government by kingship for government by judges was based upon the Lord’s commandments (Mosiah 29:30). The idea that an unrighteous king would inevitably lead his people to serious iniquity was a defining issue for the Nephites during the reign of the judges (Mosiah 29:12-36). <br><br>
Helaman wrote concerning his young warriors: "But behold, they have received many wounds; nevertheless they stand fast in that liberty wherewith God has made them free; and they are strict to remember the Lord their God from day to day; yea, they do observe to keep his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments continually; and their faith is strong in the prophecies concerning that which is to come" (Alma 58:40).  <br><br>
Similarly, Pahoran’s uses of Alma’s phrase in his epistle (Alma 61:9, 21) signaled to Moroni that, as chief judge, he too was fully committed to righteous government and the fulfillment of his oath (Alma 50:39). He opposed the efforts of the kingmen to replace him with a king because he knew that such would lead to bondage from sin, as well as political bondage.  <br><br>

The phrase "stand fast in the liberty wherewith God has made us free" refers to more than political liberty; it is also freedom from sin. Men like Alma I, Helaman, and Moroni knew all too well that unrighteous leaders seeking power would lead their people into iniquity. When we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how we can avoid being led astray by the unrighteous examples of others, and how we can stand in holy places and obtain the blessings that freedom from sin through Christ can bring to our lives.
