<i>4 Nephi 1:31</i>  <br><br>
In 4 Nephi, Mormon describes the persecution suffered by the three disciples of Jesus: <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, <b>according to his word </b></i>(4 Nephi 1:31).</p> <br><br>
We have no record in our current Book of Mormon of Jesus describing the efforts of the Jews to kill him during his mortal ministry. Apparently, the Nephites did; but Mormon does not quote them.  <br><br>
<i>Helaman 12:26 </i><br><br>
Mormon quotes the words of Jesus in his commentary on Nephite apostasy in the book of Helaman, before he gets to 3 Nephi. <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, <b>fulfilling the words which say:</b> They that have done good shall have everlasting life, and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation. And thus it is. Amen </i>(Helaman 12:26).</p> <br><br>
These words, which are similar to words found in the Gospel of John 5:29, are not found in the teachings of Jesus in 3 Nephi. Assuming these were words spoken by the resurrected Jesus to the Nephites, this would be the only example where Mormon actually quotes words from Jesus’ resurrected ministry to the Nephites that are not found in that account. Usually, he only mentions a teaching of Jesus in passing, without actually providing a quotation. <br><br>
<i>Moroni 7:26, 33-34</i> <br><br>
After Mormon’s death, Moroni includes a sermon from his father on the plates. This document was not included in Mormon’s abridgment, but includes several quotations from the Savior’s resurrected ministry to the Nephites not found elsewhere in the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
<p left-margin: 5%><i>And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth <b>he spake these words unto our fathers,</b> saying: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you </i>(Moroni 7:26). <br><br>
<i><b>And Christ hath said:</b> If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me </i>(Moroni 7:33). <br><br>
<i><b>And he hath said:</b> Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved </i>(Moroni 7:34). </p> <br><br>
The last passage is similar to, but not the same as, that in 3 Nephi 27:20, which does not include the words "and have faith in me, that ye may be saved," suggesting that this was from another source. These additional quotations do not come from Mormon’s abridgment, but fortuitously from Moroni’s inclusion of his father’s sermon. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Mormon informs the latter-day reader that he only gave us a small part of the teachings of Jesus available to him in his abridgment. His repeated references to additional teachings in only a general way is consistent with his explanation that he does so by divine commandment. In spite of his personal inclination to include everything the resurrected Jesus taught his ancestors, he was submissive and obedient to the Lord’s counsel. <br><br>
Significantly, we <b><i>do</i></b> receive some of these additional teachings in the portion of the Book of Mormon prepared by Mormon’s son, Moroni, who includes a sermon that was not part of his father’s abridgment. The inclusion of these few additional words of Jesus, indirectly through Moroni’s selection, constitutes one of the tender mercies of the Lord, for which we can be thankful.
