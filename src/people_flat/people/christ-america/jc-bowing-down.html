When the resurrected Jesus descended from heaven and appeared to the people, He introduced himself as the Lord Jesus Christ. Mormon recorded that the people on this occasion remembered that it had been prophesied that He would visit them, and fell to the earth. Jesus then invited those present to arise and come forth to feel the prints of the nails in His hands and feet and the wound in His side, which they did (3 Nephi 11:14-15). "And when they had all gone forth and had witnessed for themselves, they did cry out with one accord, saying: Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did <b><i>fall down</i></b> at the feet of Jesus, and did <b><i>worship</i></b> him" (3 Nephi 11:16-17). Jesus then invited Nephi to come forth. "And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord</i></b> and did kiss his feet" (3 Nephi 11:19). <br><br>
The words "worship," "bowed," and "before" draw the reader’s attention to Nephi’s commandment to his people hundreds of years before. The multitude "did <b><i>fall down</i></b> at the feet of Jesus and did <b><i>worship</i></b> him." As the spiritual leader of the Nephites, and the namesake of his righteous ancestor, the later Nephi "<b><i>bowed</i></b> himself <b><i>before the Lord</i></b>," just as the other Nephi said he should do. In doing so, <b><i>Nephi</i></b> sets the pattern for all the <b><i>Nephites</i></b> as to what they should do.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
The practice of bowing down before the Holy One of Israel highlights the sacredness of the event in 3 Nephi. Bowing down no doubt helped to focus the attention of the people, placing them in a state of readiness to receive His teachings. These actions also suggest that they were physically offering their entire might, mind, strength, and whole soul before the Holy One of Israel, in willingness and readiness to obey, which is the essence of true worship (2 Nephi 25:29; Omni 1:26; Moroni 10:32). We should ponder how our own actions, including our pattern of worship, can better reflect our willingness and readiness to serve the Lord.
