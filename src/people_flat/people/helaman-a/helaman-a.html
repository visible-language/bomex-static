The main focus of Helaman’s epistle is war, and this is reflected in his language. Only Helaman uses the words "supply," "surrendered," "sallying," "secrete," "faction," "movements," "retreats," "toiling," "weariness," "convey," "opposed," and "ordered." These are all words associated with the labors and strategies of armies. Helaman uses other words and phrases which, although used by other Book of Mormon voices, expand his military vocabulary. These include references to army sizes, cities as objects of defense or attack, "prisoners," "march," "army," and "strength." <br><br>
Helaman uses the verb "deliver" five times, in the sense of delivering weapons or prisoners to an opposing force or to confinement elsewhere. Another five times, "deliver" is used in reference to God delivering Helaman and his people from their enemies. Helaman’s words suggest that he understood the events of his life through the lens of the scriptures, and that he benefited from a knowledge of the plates of brass. Examples of this can be seen in his use of war strategies likely found on the plates of brass and the Lord’s counsel to his ancestor Joshua (See <i>Helaman’s War Strategies</i> and <i>God’s Counsel to Joshua</i> in this directory). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Helaman’s language is consistent with that of a man experienced with war, but it also shows how faith in God can support one through such experiences. When we read Helaman’s words, we should ponder how we can view our own challenges through the eye of faith and recognize the tender mercies of the Lord, even in the most difficult circumstances.
