The prophet Jacob uses Isaiah’s writings in his sermons on the small plates of Nephi to supplement his own inspired teachings (see chart on Jacob’s use of Isaiah). Readers of the Book of Mormon can benefit from a careful comparison of the words found in 2 Nephi 7-8 (Isaiah 50-51; 52:1-2) and 2 Nephi 9-10. <br><br>
Isaiah spoke of the scattering and exile of Israel. Jacob expands upon these ideas by likening those curses to the Fall of Man. Jacob’s text of Isaiah varies from the biblical version. In Jacob’s Isaiah text, the Lord asks, "Have I <b><i>cast thee off</i></b> forever?" (2 Nephi 7:1). The Lord explains that He has not forgotten His people, even though they have transgressed and been scattered. He still has power to deliver and redeem them, when they are willing to answer His call (2 Nephi 7:2).  <br><br>
Jacob describes the Fall and death as having come about through man’s "<b><i>transgression,"</i></b> through which man, like rebellious Israel, was "<b><i>cut off</i></b> from the presence of the Lord," and scattered Israel was cut off from the land of promise (2 Nephi 9:6). Death and the Fall are remedied through the sufferings and death of the Creator Himself, who provided an infinite atonement (2 Nephi 9:5, 7). <br><br>
Isaiah refers to God’s power to dry up the waters (2 Nephi 7:2) and to the Lord’s earlier deliverance of Israel at the Red Sea, where He divided the waters and made a "way for the ransomed to pass over" on dry ground (2 Nephi 8:9-10). The waters are like death, which God has the power to utterly abolish. Just as He made a way for His people to pass through the sea to a new life beyond, so the Lord would die to bring about the resurrection of all mankind.  <br><br>
Jacob reads the promise that "the redeemed of the Lord shall return" (2 Nephi 8:11) in light of the resurrection. This return will be a joyful event for the righteous, while the wicked who die in their sins (since all will be resurrected) shall "return" to God in the judgment, and "behold his face, and remain in their sins" (2 Nephi 9:38), a prospect that will fill them with unspeakable dread and terror (2 Nephi 9:46). <br><br>
Isaiah speaks of the Lord’s righteousness and holiness and invites the Lord’s people to hearken to God’s words. He stresses the impermanence of mortality in the natural world, in contrast to the Lord’s righteousness and holiness, which are forever (2 Nephi 8:6-8, 12-15). Jacob draws upon Isaiah’s language to teach how the redemption of the Holy One of Israel allows His people to share in His righteousness, His holiness, and eternal salvation when they hearken to His words and trust in Him (2 Nephi 9:13-14, 18).  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
A comparison of Isaiah’s words in 2 Nephi 7-8 with the teachings of Jacob in 2 Nephi 9-10 shows that Isaiah’s words were an integral part of Jacob’s sermon. They enabled him to teach the plan of salvation to his people in one of the most remarkable discourses in scriptural literature. When we read Isaiah’s words in 2 Nephi 7-8, we should compare them with Jacob’s subsequent teachings, and ponder how they can increase our understanding of the plan of salvation.
