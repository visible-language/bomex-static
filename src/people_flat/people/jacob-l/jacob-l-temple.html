Lehi said that Jacob’s days would be "spent in the service of thy God" (2 Nephi 2:3), and Jacob and his younger brother Joseph were consecrated by Nephi to be the first priests over the people of Nephi (2 Nephi 5:26). Notably, Jacob’s vocabulary reflects this calling as a righteous priest. <br><br>
Jacob uses the noun "atonement" eight times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon (2 Nephi 9:7, 25-26; Jacob 4:11-12; 7:12). This term figures prominently in priestly texts, such as Leviticus, which discuss Israelite sacrificial practices. References to "fatness," (2 Nephi 9:51), "first-fruits" (Jacob 4:11), Abraham’s offering of his son Isaac as a symbol of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God (Jacob 4:5), and the image of garments stained with blood (2 Nephi 9:44; Jacob 1:19), all evoke the sacrifices and offerings of ancient temple worship. This background seems to provide the context for many of Jacob’s teachings. <br><br>
In ancient Israel, the temple represented the presence of God and was considered holy. Jacob uses the divine title "Holy One of Israel" 17 times, more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon. Others who use the title include Nephi (10 times) Isaiah in the Book of Mormon (7 times), Amaleki (2 times), Lehi (2 times), and Zenos (2 times). Significantly, all of these are found in the words of writers on the small plates, except for 3 Nephi 22:5, where Jesus quotes Isaiah. <br><br>
Righteous temple worship demanded ritual purity, and deliberate preparation. Those who were not ritually pure were not allowed to enter. Jacob speaks of the righteous being "clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness" (2 Nephi 9:14), which recalls the whiteness of ancient priestly clothing. He vividly contrasts uncleanliness or filthiness, sin, transgression, and guilt with holiness, purity, and righteousness. Those who are unclean or filthy are cut off from God’s presence, just as the ritually unprepared are shut out from the temple (2 Nephi 9:6, 9). A certain knowledge of God’s holiness and the existence of abominations and wickedness among his own people cause Jacob "to shrink with shame before the presence of [his] Maker" (Jacob 2:6). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Jacob’s language evokes temple symbolism. Jacob’s unshakable faith was nurtured by his service to God throughout his life and his ability to recognize Christ and His plan of mercy in those activities. When we read Jacob’s words, we should ponder how the blessings of the temple can bless us, strengthen us, and increase our hope and love for God and those around us.
