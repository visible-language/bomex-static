      Moroni, alone among Nephite record keepers, uses the word "Jehovah," and he only does so in the concluding line of the Book of Mormon (Moroni 10:34). The only other place in the Book of Mormon where the name Jehovah appears is where Nephi is citing Isaiah from the plates of brass in 2 Nephi 22:2 (Isaiah 12:2). If, as in the Old Testament, that name represents a literal translation of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton (the sacred and protected name of God), or its equivalent in the language of the Nephites, this may be significant. <sup>1</sup> <br><br>

Moroni, after promising that we would see him before the bar of God at the day of judgment, and inviting us to come unto Christ, the Holy One of Israel, evokes the name Jehovah, just as he concludes the record. He essentially seals the record with the sacred name of God, thereby placing the Lord’s stamp of approval upon all that is written there.  <br><br>
As we read the Book of Mormon and ponder its precepts, we should always remember that we are reading a sacred record, and that we will be held accountable before God at the last day for the manner in which we received and followed the prophetic teachings that it contains.
