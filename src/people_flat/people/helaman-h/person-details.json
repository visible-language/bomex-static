  "description": "Helaman was the son of Helaman who was the son of Alma, and kept the plates of Nephi after the death of his uncle Shiblon (Alma 63:11). He lived during a tumultuous time in Nephite history. He became the chief judge following the death of the three sons of Pahoran and survived an attempted assassination plot. During this time, the Church of God experienced remarkable growth (Helaman 3:24-26), followed by significant dissension and apostasy (Helaman 3:33-36).\n\n Despite these challenges, Helaman taught his two sons Nephi and Lehi in the ways of the Lord (Helaman 3:21; 5:5), and \"he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father\" (Helaman 3:37). He died after reigning 11 years.",
