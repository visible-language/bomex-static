One of the signs of the Lord’s death that would be witnessed by the house of Israel was "the <b><i>opening of the earth"</i></b> (1 Nephi 19:11). God had previously told Moses that He would visit the children of Israel according to their future sins. One remarkable example of such a visitation occurred during the rebellion of Korah and his followers.  <br><br> 
The book of Numbers tells of a rebellion led by Korah and his followers, in which they tried to usurp divine authority and power from Moses. Moses responded, "If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be <b><i>visited</i></b> after the <b><i>visitation</i></b> of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the <b><i>earth open her mouth, and swallow them up,</i></b> with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord" (Numbers 16:29-30).  <br><br> 
We are then told that the rebels were visited with destruction when the "<b><i>earth opened</i></b> her mouth and swallowed them up" (Numbers 16:32-35; 26:10). We are also told that these wicked people and their fate "<b><i>became a sign"</i></b> for the children of Israel to remember (Numbers 26:10). It is very significant, then, that Zenos mentions that the "opening of the earth" would be a sign to the house of Israel of the Lord’s death. <br><br> 
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br> 
"The opening of the earth" (1 Nephi 19:11), a sign of the Lord’s death given by the prophet Zenos, resembles the fate of Korah and his followers during the sojourn of the Israelites in the wilderness. Significantly, that event was specifically said to be a sign to the house of Israel. Zenos teaches that it was a sign of the Lord’s death. When we read the prophecy of Zenos, we should consider how the events of Israel’s history point to the Savior and His redemption.  <br><br> 
Death swallows us all, but through the grace and merciful intercession of Jesus Christ, we all can be redeemed from the grave and, through diligent effort and faith in Him, receive eternal life.
