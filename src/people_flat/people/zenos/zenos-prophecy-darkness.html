When the Lord brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, He caused three days of darkness to cover the land. "And there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings" (Exodus 10:21-23). The prophet Zenos stated that three days of darkness "should be a sign given of his [the Lord’s] death unto those who should inhabit the isles of the sea, more especially given unto those who are of the house of Israel" (1 Nephi 19:10). <br><br>
The Lord, through Moses, provided the darkness at the time of Israel’s deliverance from cruel bondage. Zenos indicates that three days of darkness, obviously intended to remind Israel of the Egyptian deliverance, would be a sign of the Lord’s death, an event that would bring about deliverance from death and sin. During the darkness in Egypt, Israel had light in their dwellings; but in the sign mentioned by Zenos, Israel would also experience the darkness, a reminder that the God of Israel would suffer for the sins of His people and that they must look to Him as the source of light and life. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
As we read the prophecy of Zenos, we should ponder how the Lord can bring light to us in times of darkness, and remember that ultimately, He is the only true source of light to guide us and lead us away from choices that would drag us down to darkness and misery.
