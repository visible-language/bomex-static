<b>74 B.C.</b> Korihor preaches among the people of Nephi and leads many people astray. He is rejected in the lands of Jershon and Gideon, and carried before Nephihah and Alma in Zarahemla. He rails against God, demands a sign, and is smitten dumb. He begs for food among the Zoramites and is trampled to death.
