<p margin-left: 5%><i>Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted. <br><br>
Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them. <br><br>
But behold, they are in the hands of the Lord of the harvest, and they are his; and he will raise them up at the last day </i>(Alma 26:5-7). </p>
<b>Key Insights </b><br><br>
Ammon’s teachings show that the Lord of the harvest not only knows how to gather His people, but also how to protect, preserve, and seal them from the power of the enemy. When we read Ammon’s words, we should ponder how kind and merciful the Lord is to us and those around us, as He guides us to places and experiences that can bless, strengthen, and save us.
