Father Lehi’s vision of the tree of life provides us with a pattern applicable to our own lives, as we seek to overcome worldly influences and partake of the love of God. Lehi saw that as many were seeking to lay hold upon the word of God that would led them to the tree, "there arose a <b><i>mist of darkness;</i></b> yea, even an exceedingly great mist of darkness, insomuch that those who had commenced in the path did lose their way, that they wandered off and were lost" (1 Nephi 8:23). He also saw that others took hold of the rod of iron and "did press forward through the mist of darkness" until they were able to come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree of life (1 Nephi 8:24). <br><br>
Later, Lehi’s son Nephi had a vision in which he saw the things his father saw and received an angelic interpretation of the symbols in the dream. The angel taught that "the mists of darkness are the <b><i>temptations</i></b> of the devil, which <b><i>blindeth</i></b> the eyes, and <b><i>hardeneth</i></b> the hearts of the children of men, and <b><i>leadeth them away</i></b> into broad roads, that they perish and are lost" (1 Nephi 12:17). After his vision, Nephi taught his brothers that the rod of iron "was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the <b><i>temptations</i></b> and fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto <b><i>blindness,</i></b> to <b><i>lead them away</i></b> to destruction" (1 Nephi 15:24). <br><br>
In Amulek’s teachings to the Zoramites, we see how he draws upon Nephi’s description of the mists of darkness to highlight the importance of daily prayer, so that the temptations of the adversary do not overpower us. Mormon uses this same language to highlight the dangers of apostasy.<br><br>
