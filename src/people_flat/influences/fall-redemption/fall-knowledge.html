Consider the language related to knowledge used by the Lord and Moroni in the story of the Brother of Jared. In Ether, divinely given knowledge brings salvation, rather than death. Previous to his remarkable vision, Jared’s brother "<b><i><b><i>knew</i></b> not" that the Lord had a body (Ether 3:8). Later, the Lord says, "Because thou <b><i>knowest</i></b> these things ye are redeemed from the fall" (Ether 3:13). Where previously, partaking of the fruit resulted in man’s fall, expulsion, and death, receiving the true knowledge of God through faith resulted in his redemption. That knowledge was given "that this man might <b><i>know</i></b> that he was God" (Ether 3:18). "And because of the <b><i>knowledge</i></b> of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil . . .  for he <b><i>knew, nothing doubting" (Ether 3:19). He had "this perfect <b><i>knowledge</i></b> of God" (Ether 3:20), and "he <b><i>knew</i></b> that the Lord could show him all things" (Ether 3:26). <br><br>
Moroni also reminds us that those who believe these things will also receive the Spirit, and "shall <b><i>know</i></b> and bear record. For because of my Spirit, he shall <b><i>know</i></b> that these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do <b><i>good.</i></b> And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do <b><i>good</i></b> is of me; for <b><i>good</i></b> cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all <b><i>good"</i></b> (Ether 4:11-12).  <br><br>
The Lord also invites us, the readers of this account, to come unto Him, so that He can show us "the <b><i>knowledge</i></b> which is hid up because of unbelief" (Ether 4:13). He invites us all, like the Brother of Jared, to rend the veil of unbelief that causes us to remain in in a state of blindness. The Lord wants us to open our eyes, and when they are, "then shall [we] <b><i>know"</i></b> (Ether 4:15-17). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
The Lord will provide knowledge to the faithful and obedient, but, as Moroni’s account of the Brother of Jared shows, it must be sought, and can only be found in the Lord’s way. The Brother of Jared obtained knowledge through persistent faith, repentance, obedience, and prayer. Having proven to the Lord that he was willing to follow this righteous pattern, the Lord blessed him with great knowledge.  <br><br>
Moroni frames these blessings of knowledge in language from the Fall of Man, in which a knowledge of good things is not taken by man, but generously provided by the Lord, once a person has shown they are capable, willing, and worthy to receive it. As we read the story of Jared’s brother, we should ponder how we can wisely use the knowledge of good that the Lord provides to bless the lives of others.
