In his account of the Brother of Jared and his people, Moroni uses language from the story of the Fall of Man found in Genesis and the restored account in the book of Moses. The Genesis account of the Fall says that, following Adam’s transgression, the Lord "<b><i>drove out</i></b> the man" (Genesis 3:24). After he murdered his brother Abel, Cain also remarked that God had "<b><i>driven me out"</i></b> (Genesis 4:14). Jared asks his brother to "go and inquire of the Lord whether he will <b><i>drive us out</i></b> of the land, and if he will <b><i>drive us out</i></b> of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go" (Ether 1:38). Later, the Brother of Jared notes that the Lord had "<b><i>driven us forth"</i></b> (Ether 2:15). The departure from the land of the great tower into the wilderness is like being driven out of the Garden of Eden into the painful and difficult world. <br><br>
Other words in the account highlight the separation between the Jaredites and God during their journey. After they transgressed, Adam and Eve are said to have "hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God" (Genesis 3:8). Cain is likewise described as being separated from "the presence of the Lord" (Genesis 4:16). This separation is amplified in the book of Moses where, after they had been driven out of the garden, the Lord did not converse with man face to face as He had before. "And they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they <b><i>saw him not;</i></b> for they were shut out from his presence" (Moses 5:4).  <br><br>
Moroni describes the Brother of Jared’s encounters with the Lord during their wilderness journey using similar wording. Moroni wrote, "The Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared <b><i>saw him not"</i></b> (Ether 2:4). Later, as they continued their journey, the Lord "did talk with them as he stood in a cloud" (Ether 2:5). After being driven out of the land of their origin (Ether 1:38; 3:3), the Jaredites are represented as being like Adam and Eve after being driven out of the garden, who only heard the Lord’s voice giving them commandments. It is also interesting that Moroni’s wording "saw him not" does not come from the Genesis account, but from the account in the book of Moses, which was restored by Joseph Smith.  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
By using language from the account of the Fall of Man, Moroni sets up the story of the Brother of Jared as a story that shows the pattern of redemption through faith in Jesus Christ. As we read the account in the book of Ether, we should ponder the many ways that the Lord was merciful to the Jaredites during their difficult journey. We should also ponder the many ways the Lord is kind and merciful to us, as we travel through an often dark and dreary world.
