In the scriptural account of the Fall, we learn that by partaking of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the eyes of the man and the woman were opened. "For God doth know that in the day that ye eat thereof, then your <b><i>eyes shall be opened,</i></b> and ye shall <b><i>be as the gods, knowing good and evil."</i></b> The tree was "to be desired to make one <b><i>wise,"</i></b> and after they partook, "the <b><i>eyes</i></b> of them both were <b><i>opened"</i></b> (Genesis 3:6-7). <br><br>
After describing the Satanic introduction of secret combinations among the Jaredites, Moroni warns the latter-day reader of the Book of Mormon: "Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is <b><i>wisdom</i></b> in God that these things should be <b><i>shown</i></b> unto you" (Ether 8:23). Moroni’s words show that he wants to <b><i>open </i>our<i> eyes</i></b> and give <i>us</i> a <b><i>knowledge of evil</i></b> combinations so that we can be aware of them and protect ourselves against their dangers. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Moroni uses words that remind us of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and its qualities to show us how to be wise. God-given wisdom, provided through the Book of Mormon in our day, alerts us beforehand to the dangers these evils pose to families, societies, and nations. As we read the Book of Mormon, we should ponder how revelation from God through the Book of Mormon and latter-day prophets, seers, and revelators can help us to become aware of and avoid contemporary dangers.
