One insight about the Fall of Man is not found in Genesis, but was restored in the book of Moses. After they were driven out of the garden, Adam and Eve called upon the name of the Lord in prayer. "And Adam and Eve, his wife, <b><i>called upon the name of the Lord"</i></b> (Moses 5:4). God sent an angel commanding them, "Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and <b><i>call upon God in the name of the Son</i></b> forevermore" (Moses 5:8). It is clear that Adam and Eve were obedient and followed this pattern of prayer, which included the principle of repentance, throughout their lives. "And Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to <b><i>call upon God"</i></b> (Moses 5:16). <br><br>
When he and his people were driven out of their homeland, the brother of Jared had already established a pattern of crying unto God for blessings and counsel (Ether 1:34-39, 43). At one point, however, the brother of Jared became neglectful of this commandment and was reproved for it. As the Lord stood in the cloud, He chastened the brother of Jared "because he remembered not to <b><i>call upon the name of the Lord.</i></b> And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did <b><i>call upon the name of the Lord</i></b> for his brethren who were with him" (Ether 2:14-15). It is clear that this practice of calling upon the name of the Lord included the principle of repentance, as it had been taught long before in the time of Adam and Eve. As he faithfully continued this pattern, the brother of Jared was greatly blessed. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights </b><br><br>
As Moroni describes, the brother of Jared followed the pattern revealed and taught to Adam and Eve of repenting and calling upon the name of the Lord. Even though the Jaredites were not yet prepared to enter the presence of God, the principle of righteous prayer helped them continue in the covenant path and receive the guidance and blessings that they needed in their journey.  <br><br>
As we read the account of the brother of Jared and his people, we should ponder how much we truly need to repent and call upon our Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. As it was with the brother of Jared and his people, this can be a source of comfort and power that will help us more fully appreciate how the Lord loves us and helps us, as we face the challenges in our lives.
