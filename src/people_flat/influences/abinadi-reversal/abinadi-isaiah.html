Those who read Abinadi’s words may wonder how his teachings and his response to the priests’ questions relate to the words of Isaiah. In his defense before King Noah and his priests, Abinadi is asked to explain the meaning of Isaiah 52:7-10, in light of his negative prophecies about them and the people. Noah, his priests, and his people thought of themselves as righteous, and presumptively applied the blessings mentioned by Isaiah to themselves. In response, Abinadi expounded upon this passage, but also drew upon other parts of Isaiah that surround the passage in question. Readers of Abinadi’s words can be rewarded by noting key words and phrases that are used by both prophets (See <i>Chart on the Words of Abinadi and Isaiah</i>). <br><br>
Both Isaiah and Abinadi refer to "his people" and "my people." <b><i>Who</i></b> are the Lord’s people? Both Isaiah and Abinadi make clear that it is those who trust in Him, "hearken" and "give ear" to his law and commandments (Isaiah 51:1, 4-5, 7; Mosiah 15:11), and "in whose heart is my law" (Isaiah 51:7). Abinadi seems to reference this passage when, after noting the priests’ refusal to keep the law of Moses, he cites the ten commandments, "for I perceive that they are not written in your hearts" (Mosiah 13:11). It is interesting that Abinadi references the version of the Isaiah passage on the small plates of Nephi, cited years earlier by Jacob, which reads "in whose heart I have <b><i>written</i></b> my law" (2 Nephi 8:7), rather than the one from our current Bible (Isaiah 51:7).<br><br>
Christ suffered and bore the transgressions of His people (those who hearken to Him and keep His commandments) and He makes "intercession" for them (Isaiah 53:12; Mosiah 15:8-9). Isaiah taught that the Lord "pleadeth the cause of his people" (Isaiah 51:22). This merciful intercession is available to those who hearken to His words, but can be refused by those who rebel and go on in the ways of sin (Mosiah 15:26-27; 16:5, 12). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
As we read and study Abinadi’s words, we should ask ourselves how Isaiah’s words would have answered the questions asked by Noah’s priests. We should also ponder what our daily behavior says about our relationship to the Lord. Does our behavior show that we are His people?
