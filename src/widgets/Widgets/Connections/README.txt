I inherited this and changed the following
-unified styles
-basic mobile optimization

It still needs
-Data (most of the data is filler data)
-To fetch the images from a shared source instead of local copies
-Probably restructuring of how data is fetched in general.

-Moving forward, we either need to decide on like 12 people to put on this or figure out how to only put on subsets of the Book of Mormon at a given time. (If there are going to be 100 speakers and you click on one and it draws an arch that skips over 75 people that seems kind of iffy.)
