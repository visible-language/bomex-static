  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Zenos was an Israelite prophet whose writings were recorded on the plates of brass. Selections of his words are found in a prophecy cited by Nephi (1 Nephi 19:11-17), his olive allegory reproduced by Jacob (Jacob 5:2-77), and a prayer quoted by Alma to the Zoramites (Alma 33:4-11). Only the resurrected Jesus and Isaiah are cited more than Zenos by Book of Mormon speakers.</p>

      Mormon states that, like Zenock, he was a Nephite ancestor, although it is unknown whether he was from the tribe of Ephraim or Manasseh (3 Nephi 10:16). Evidenced by a selection of his writings, Zenos appears to have been an Israelite prophet who likely preached sometime between David’s conquest of Jerusalem and the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel.<sup>1</sup>  According to Nephi the son of Helaman, Zenos testified boldly about the coming of Christ; after which, he was slain (Helaman 8:19). <br><br>
Given the subject of his olive allegory (Jacob 5), it is not surprising to find that agricultural vocabulary is abundant, with the words "vineyard" (57 times), "fruit" (56), "natural fruit" (10), "tree" (51), "trees" (16), "branches" (35), "natural branches" (13), and "roots" (17). Verbs relating to actions taken in relation to the vineyard with its trees include "brought" (23), "cast" (17), "nourished" (16), "graft" (14), "become" (13), "preserve" (13), "bring" (11), "lay up" or "lay it up" (11), "labor" (9), and "perish" (9). The title "God of nature" (1 Nephi 19:12) is only used by Zenos. Zenos is second only to Mormon (33) in the number of statistically significant phrases (31). This is even more notable because Zenos has fewer words (4,272) compared to Mormon (96,935). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
A comparison of the words of Zenos with those of other writers quoted from in the Book of Mormon, indicates that he was one of the most significant sources of prophetic teachings in the Nephite literary corpus. As we read the words of Zenos throughout the Book of Mormon, we can come to more fully appreciate the rich scriptural heritage contained in the plates of brass.
