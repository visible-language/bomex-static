  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Alma II was the son of Alma I who organized the Church of Christ among the people of King Noah in the land of Nephi. In his earlier life Alma had been a wicked man but was converted to Christ after the miraculous intervention of an angel of God (Mosiah 27:8-37). King Mosiah entrusted him with the sacred archive of Nephite records (Mosiah 28:20). Following the death of his father Alma became High Priest over the Church. Alma also served as the first Chief Judge over the people of Nephi for eight years after which he voluntarily gave up the judgment seat to spend the remainder of his life preaching the Gospel (Alma 4:16-19).</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>

      <p>
Alma refers to God’s plan 18 times, more than any other single speaker, and more than all other speakers combined. His most common phrase is the "plan of redemption" (11 times), "plan of salvation" (once), "plan of restoration" (once), "plan of happiness" (2 times), and "plan of mercy" (3 times). The last three phrases are only used by him. He uses the phrase "it came to pass" only about one-eleventh as often and the word "king" only about one-eighth as often as the rest of the Book of Mormon writers. <br><br>
Alma uses the word "spirit" primarily in reference to the Spirit of God, or the gift which comes from Him: "the Spirit" (11 times), "Spirit of God" (7 times), "Holy Spirit" (4 times), "spirit of prophecy" (4 times), "spirit of revelation" (4 times), "Spirit of the Lord" (3 times), "born of the Spirit" (once), "his Spirit" (once), "spirit of truth" (once), as opposed to the "spirit of the soul" of man (once), or that of the adversary, "spirit of the devil" (once), and "lying spirit" (once). With two exceptions, all references to spiritual rebirth in the Book of Mormon are from Alma’s testimony and teachings. These include the phrases "born of God" (8 times), "born again" (4 times), and "born of the Spirit" (once). The last phrase is unique to Alma.<br><br>
Alma’s teachings are influenced by the teachings of Lehi, Nephi, and Jacob from the plates of Nephi, and the teachings of Abinadi witnessed and recorded by his father. We can hear echoes of his own conversion experience as he invites others to repent and come unto Christ. Like the sons of Mosiah, Alma seemingly cannot bear the thought that any should perish. "And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance" (Alma 13:27).<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Alma’s anxiety for the eternal welfare of others was clearly based on the memory and knowledge of his own past experiences, when he turned back from the edge of misery and self-destruction to partake of the joyful fruit of the tree of life (Alma 36:24). When we read Alma’s words, we should ponder how merciful the Lord was to him. That mercy also extends to us, as we strive to repent, follow these teachings, and come unto Christ.
