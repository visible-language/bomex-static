  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Alma I was a descendant of Nephi. His immediate ancestors were among those who accompanied Zeniff in their resettlement of the lands of Nephi-Lehi and Shilom. When he was still a young man, King Noah appointed Alma as one of his priests. When the prophet Abinadi was brought before King Noah and his court, Alma became convinced of the truth of his words and attempted to persuade King Noah to spare the prophet’s life. Noah, angered by Alma’s support of the prophet, cast him out and sent servants to try to kill him; but Alma escaped and hid. 

 Alma repented of his sins, recorded the words of Abinadi, and began to secretly teach them to the people. Several hundred people believed in these teachings, so Alma baptized them and organized them into a church at the Waters of Mormon. When King Noah learned of Alma’s activities, he sent an army to destroy him and his followers. Alma and his people escaped into the wilderness, where they founded another settlement that they named Helam.

 Although greatly loved by his people, Alma refused to be their king. They were brought into bondage by a group of Lamanites led by Amulon, one of Noah’s former priests, but were miraculously delivered by God. They migrated to the land of Zarahemla, where King Mosiah II permitted Alma to organize the Church of God among his people. Alma was a man of great faith and died at the age of 82.</p>
  <h2>Insights into the Words and Phrases</h2>
<details class="accordion"><summary><span>Did you know that Alma’s words show influences from the words of the prophet Abinadi?</span><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></summary><div class="accordion-body"><div class="analysis">
      <p>
Alma uses the divine title "Almighty God," when he baptizes. This title is used only four times by four speakers in the Book of Mormon. Alma is the first to use the words "bonds" and "bonds of iniquity" in the text. Both the single word and the phrase appear five times. In addition to Alma I, only Alma the Younger and Mormon use the phrase "bonds of iniquity." Alma uses each of them once in his 577 words, which is a rate much higher than that in the rest of the text. <br><br>
Although we only have 577 words from Alma I, Abinadi’s influence can still be detected. This suggests that Abinadi’s words and testimony of Christ were always at the back of Alma’s mind. Alma’s references to "<b><i>eternal life"</i></b> and "<b><i>the first resurrection"</i></b> in his words at the Waters of Mormon (Mosiah 18:9, 13) echo Abinadi’s testimony before king Noah (Mosiah 15:21-25; 18:9, 13). This is also true of his reference to Christ’s redemption being "<b><i>prepared from the foundation of the world"</i></b> (Mosiah 15:19; 18:13) and the Lord’s people being identified as those who are redeemed of God (Mosiah 15:18-19, 23; 18:9). <br><br>
It is also interesting to contrast Alma’s positive characterization of the newly baptized people of the Lord, as those who are <b><i>willing</i></b> to serve God, have <b><i>righteous desires,</i></b> and strive to <b><i>keep the commandments</i></b> (Mosiah 18:8, 10), with Abinadi’s warning against those who go "according to their <b><i>own carnal wills</i></b> and <b><i>desires"</i></b> (Mosiah 16:12), and do not "<b><i>keep the commandments"</i></b> (Mosiah 12:33). Here, Alma takes what he learned from Abinadi’s warning and applies it positively to the new converts. <br><br>
Abinadi’s discourse before Noah began with a passage from Isaiah, which said, "the Lord hath <b><i>comforted</i></b> his people" (Mosiah 12:23). This reminds us of Alma’s observation that the repentant converts desired "to be called <b><i>his people" (Mosiah 18:8) and would "<b><i>comfort</i></b> those that stand in need of <b><i>comfort"</i></b> (Mosiah 18:9). One way the Lord comforts His people is through having them minister to one another.<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Alma clearly continued to study and ponder Abinadi’s words. When we read Alma’s words, we should do so in light of Abinadi’s testimony. As we ponder the teachings of these prophets, we can apply their wisdom to new situations and bless and minister to others.
