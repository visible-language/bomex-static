  <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
  <p>Moroni was the son of Mormon, the last Nephite record keeper in the Book of Mormon, and a missionary (Moroni 8:1-2). During the battle at Cumorah, he led a cohort of 10,000 and he was one of only twenty-four Nephites who survived the battle (Mormon 6:11-12). After the death of his father Mormon, he wandered for more than thirty-five years until he was able to finish, seal up, and bury the plates in the hill in New York. Moroni’s words include biographical and prophetic material written after his father’s death (Mormon 7-9), his abridgement and commentary on the record of Ether (Ether 1-15), instructions on Church government (Moroni 1-6), and his farewell words to future readers (Moroni 10).</p>

      <p>
      Moroni is the only speaker among the top eight in the Book of Mormon whose use of the words "Christ" and "faith" are both in his top-50 contextual words and statistically significant. Moroni only mentions the Lamanites at a rate of about one-fourth the rate of the rest of the Book of Mormon. Words unique to Moroni include "Hebrew" (3), "imagined" (3), and "imperfection" (3). Other words that only occur in his abridgement of Ether’s record include 26 proper names not mentioned anywhere else in the Book of Mormon, "dwelt in captivity" (7), "tight like unto a dish" (5), and "slept" (4). <br><br>
Moroni’s words include some of his own revelations from God, but one of his significant characteristics as a writer is his tendency to pepper his words with those of earlier writers. As one scholar observes, "His first inclination is to use the words of his predecessors," and he does so "by interweaving distinctive phrases and structural schemes from multiple thematically related sources."<sup>1</sup>  He is familiar with Isaiah (Mormon 8:23; Moroni 10:31). He also includes teachings from his father, including a sermon on faith, hope, and charity (Moroni 7), a letter condemning the baptism of little children by members of the Church of Christ (Moroni 8), and a letter describing the wickedness of the Nephites in their final days (Moroni 9). It is clear that Moroni’s father’s teachings had a tremendous influence on him. <br><br>
In addition to the small plates, which were included with the abridgment (Words of Mormon 1:1-8), Moroni also knows of and cites teachings of the resurrected Jesus that were not included in the account in 3 Nephi (Mormon 9:22-25; Ether 12:32-33, 35; 10:23), some of which he may have learned from the three disciples who tarried, who had ministered to him and his father (Mormon 8:10-11). Moroni uses diverse sources. His words also show a familiarity with the small plates of Nephi (See <i>The Influence of the Plates of Nephi.</i>).  <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Moroni’s familiarity with the teachings of earlier Nephite prophets is consistent with a writer who was the last record keeper of the Nephites. He saw himself as the last in a long line of prophets with the responsibility to testify of Christ and the gospel, as taught by the Lord to his people. "Behold, I speak unto you as if ye were present, and yet ye are not. But behold, Jesus Christ hath shown you unto me, and I know your doing" (Mormon 8:35). As we read Moroni’s words, it may be helpful to put ourselves in his shoes as we ponder what he wrote, and ask why, among so many other teachings, he felt these would be the most important for us in our day.

<sup>1</sup>  Grant Hardy, <i>Understanding the Book of Mormon: A Reader’s Guide</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010), 266. Hardy notes, "By employing the words of others, Moroni shifts the notion of authorship and makes himself the self-effacing inheritor, or spokesman, for an entire literary tradition. He is able to appeal to the authority of past prophets and record keepers (at the same time reinforcing the respect due them), and he can reward close readers who are able to recognize phrases and make connections. His allusions and quotations are a call to remembrance and a recognition of how dependent he is on the faithfulness of those who preceded him" (Hardy, 267).
