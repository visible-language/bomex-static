      <p>
The phrase "children of the covenant" appears only once in the text of the Book of Mormon; it is spoken by the resurrected Jesus to the people of Nephi (3 Nephi 20:26). Jesus taught the Nephites that, because they were of the house of Israel, they were heirs of the promise made by Him to Abraham, that through them (the children of the covenant), all the kindreds of the earth would be blessed (3 Nephi 20:25). <br><br>
The words of Jesus to the Nephites (3 Nephi 20:23-26) are similar to those taught by Peter in the New Testament (Acts 3:22-26), suggesting that Peter might have received them from the resurrected Jesus, just as the Nephites did (Acts 1:3). The phrase "children of the covenant" is more explicit in Jesus’ words to the Nephites. It is given within the context of the future of the people of the Book of Mormon and the further unfolding and fulfilment of the Lord’s covenant promises in the latter days.<br><br>
The covenant blessing includes the knowledge of a Savior, with the blessing of repentance for the children of Israel and their children. "The Father hath raised me up unto you first and sent me to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities, and this <b><i>because ye are children of the covenant"</i></b> (3 Nephi 20:26). One of the blessings of the covenant of Abraham is to have a knowledge of the Savior, how all may be redeemed from sins, and how each person may use that knowledge to bless all the families of the earth. <br><br>
Another covenant blessing available to children of the covenant is to assist in bringing the blessings of the gift of the Holy Ghost to all the kindreds of the earth (3 Nephi 20:27).<br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b><br><br>
Jesus’ reference to the Lord’s people as "children of the covenant" points to the blessings available to all Latter-day Saints, which include the blessings of redemption from sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the privilege and sacred responsibility to carry those blessings forth, to make them available to all of our Father in Heaven’s children, and to strengthen families throughout the earth. When we read the phrase "children of the covenant," it is helpful to ponder what those covenant blessings and responsibilities entail and how we can use the knowledge of the gospel and the Holy Ghost to strengthen and bless those around us.
