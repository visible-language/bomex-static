When Alma taught his son Corianton about the plan of happiness, he drew upon the earlier words of father Lehi. Alma taught that repentance could not come unto men unless there was "a <b><i>punishment,</i></b which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, <b><i>affixed opposite</i></b to the plan of <b><i>happiness,</i></b which was as eternal also as the life of the soul" (Alma 42:16). Similarly, Lehi had said that the "<b><i>punishment</i></b that is <b><i>affixed is in opposition</i></b to that of the <b><i>happiness</i></b which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement" (2 Nephi 2:10). <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
The teachings of Lehi recorded on the plates of Nephi were a blessing to Alma as he counseled his confused and troubled son. When we read Alma’s words, we should ponder how his words and those of other Book of Mormon prophets can help us to provide wise and needed counsel to our children and others who need it.
