   <b>150 B.C.</b> Abinadi preaches to King Noah’s people. He prophesies that unless they repent, they will be brought into bondage. They reject his message and seek to kill him.<br><br>
<b>148 B.C.</b> Abinadi preaches again to King Noah and his people. He prophesies that the people will be smitten and afflicted for their sins, and destroyed if they do not repent. He is taken, imprisoned, and brought before King Noah and his priests. He preaches concerning the coming of Christ, his suffering, death, resurrection from the dead, and the necessity of repentance from sin. Abinadi is offered his life, if he will recall what he has prophesied. He refuses and is put to death.
