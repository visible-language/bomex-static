<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Mormon lived through the last years of his people and witnessed their horrible decline into wickedness and depravity.  His life was, consequently, filled with much sorrow. In light of this, having seen so much in his life that was evil and discouraging, it is significant that in his writings, he focused upon the great joy that was available through the living Christ and his eternal gospel. Reasons for such joy are grounded in the mercies and blessings which the Lord bestowed upon his people, as recorded in the Book of Mormon. <br><br>
Just as focusing on Christ gave Mormon's life a foundation of great joy, reading the testimonies and teachings found in the Book of Mormon can be a source of immeasurable joy to us and can help us through the many trials and challenges of life.
