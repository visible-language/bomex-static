When Alma and his people were baptized, they made a "<b><i>covenant"</i></b> with God, witnessing their willingness to serve Him and keep His commandments (Mosiah 18:10). When Alma and his people were greatly oppressed in their bondage to the Lamanites, the Lord heard them and said, "I know of the <b><i>covenant</i></b> which <b><i>ye have made</i></b> unto me; and <b><i>I will covenant</i></b> with my people to deliver them out of bondage" (Mosiah 24:13). <br><br>
When Alma and his people were baptized, they were desirous to "come into the fold of God, and to be called <b><i>his people"</i></b> (Mosiah 18:8). Significantly, the Lord twice refers to Alma and his faithful group as "<b><i>my people"</i></b> (Mosiah 24:13-14) when he covenants to deliver them. <br><br>
Alma taught that those who entered into the baptismal covenant should be willing to "<b><i>comfort</i></b> those that stand in need of <b><i>comfort"</i></b> (Mosiah 18:9). Later, when Alma’s people were in bondage to their enemies, the Lord bid them to "lift up your heads and be of good <b><i>comfort"</i></b> (Mosiah 24:13), and to "be of good <b><i>comfort,</i></b> for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage" (Mosiah 24:17). <br><br>
Those who received the baptismal covenant were "willing to <b><i>bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light"</i></b> (Mosiah 18:8). Later, when those people were in bondage, the Lord covenanted, "<b><i>I will also ease the burdens</i></b> which are upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while ye are in bondage" (Mosiah 24:14). We are then told that "the <b><i>burdens</i></b> which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were <b><i>made light;</i></b> yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease" (Mosiah 24:15). <br><br>
When they were baptized, Alma and his people covenanted that they were willing "to <b><i>stand as witnesses</i></b> of God at all times and in all things and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9). When they were in bondage to the Lamanites, the Lord told Alma that he would bless and deliver them, "that ye may <b><i>stand as witnesses</i></b> for me hereafter" (Mosiah 24:14).
