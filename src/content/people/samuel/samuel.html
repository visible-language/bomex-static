As with many other speakers in the Book of Mormon, Samuel’s favorite topic is "the Lord," and he speaks of "God," "of the Lord," and "faith." His frequent use of the phrase "saith the Lord" (17) underscores the importance he places on the words of God in his message of warning to the people. In his message of warning, he speaks of <i>iniquity, iniquities, riches,</i> and <i>repentance.</i> Only Samuel uses the words "solid" (2), "awaiteth" (1), "declareth" (1), "demons" (1), "everlastingly" (1), "guides" (1), "late" (1), "lightning" (1), "lights" (1), "mass" (1), "slipped" (1), and "unwearied" (1). Samuel’s names for God, "eternal head," "great and eternal head," and "great and true shepherd," are unique to him. <br><br>
When Samuel returned to the city and spoke from atop the wall, the Lord told him to speak whatever the Lord put into his heart (Helaman 13:4-5). Samuel uses the phrase "saith the Lord" seventeen times, more than any other Book of Mormon speaker. There is evidence that he was inspired to draw upon some of the words from the scriptures, which he had read, searched, and pondered.  <br><br>
Samuel, as a <i>Lamanite</i> prophet, had a significant challenge. He was called to warn the <i>Nephites</i> to repent or face destruction. Seen as an outsider, his message would not be well received. "By using the words of Nephite prophets, he perhaps [hoped] that his listeners [would] be more receptive than they would be to words coming from a Lamanite."<sup>1</sup>  There are many examples of this tactic. <br><br>
When Samuel tells of the signs of Christ’s birth, just five years away, he says, "Because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken to you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you;" yet, he insists, "ye shall hear my words" (Helaman 14:10-11).  He then uses the title, "Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning" (Helaman 14:12). The only other place where this title is found is in King Benjamin’s speech, where he recites the message from the angel (Mosiah 3:8). Samuel, an unpopular outsider, quotes the Nephite king in his prophecy of the Savior’s birth. <br><br>
