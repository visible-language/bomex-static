When these converts were in danger of genocide at the hands of other Lamanites, he led them back to the land of Zarahemla, where they were permitted to settle under Nephite protection (Alma 27:1-26). He continued to live among them and served as a high priest (Alma 30:20-21). With the prophet Alma and several of his brothers, he joined the mission to Antionum to help reclaim a group of Zoramite dissenters (Alma 31:6).<br><br>
Ammon's favorite words include "brethren" (19), "my brethren" (9), "power" (8), "things" (8), "flocks" (7), "joy" (7), "of God" (7), and "the Lord" (7). He always mentions power as a gift from God, rather than worldly power over others. His use of the word "brethren" seems to underscore the love he has for the Lamanites and his fellow missionaries. Words for God, joy, love, and blessings reflect the happiness of a humble and successful missionary. <br><br>
Only Ammon uses the words "fellow servants" (2), "marvelings" (2), "bounty" (1), "brim" (1), "comprehendeth" (1), "consign" (1), "defended" (1), "dwells" (1), "garners" (1), "laughed" (1), "penetrate" (1), "privation" (1), "sickle" (1), "sleepeth" (1), and "smallest" (1). The word "reason" is 40 times more likely to be spoken by Ammon than by any other Book of Mormon speaker. Half of the references to the phrase "joy is full" in the Book of Mormon text are from Ammon. While other Book of Mormon speakers refer to God's mercy, Ammon is the only one to refer to God as "a merciful Being" (Alma 26:35). <br><br>
Ammon's description of Lehi's people as "a branch of the tree of Israel" that was "lost from its body in a strange land" (Alma 26:36), seems to draw upon the Zenos Allegory about the house of Israel as an olive tree, whose branches were scattered to different places (Jacob 5:3, 14). Ammon also seems to make use of the earlier language of King Benjamin, his grandfather, who taught that his people should believe in God, and "believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend" (Mosiah 4:9). Ammon boasted of God, "for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things" (Alma 26:35). Ammon is also the only Book of Mormon speaker, besides the angel in Benjamin's speech (Mosiah 3:19), to use the term, "natural man" (Alma 26:21).
