  "description": "Moroni was the son of Mormon, the last Nephite record keeper in the Book of Mormon, and a missionary (Moroni 8:1-2). During the battle at Cumorah, he led a cohort of 10,000 and he was one of only twenty-four Nephites who survived the battle (Mormon 6:11-12). After the death of his father Mormon, he wandered for more than thirty-five years until he was able to finish, seal up, and bury the plates in the hill in New York. Moroni’s words include biographical and prophetic material written after his father’s death (Mormon 7-9), his abridgement and commentary on the record of Ether (Ether 1-15), instructions on Church government (Moroni 1-6), and his farewell words to future readers (Moroni 10).",
