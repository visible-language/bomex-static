  <td><i>And thou art like unto our father, <b>led away</b> by the foolish imaginations of his heart; yea, he hath <b>led us out</b> of the land of Jerusalem, and we have wandered in the wilderness for these many years </i>(1 Nephi 17:20). <br><br>
<i>Our father hath judged them [the people of Jerusalem], and hath <b>led us away</b> because we would hearken unto his words; yea, and our brother is like unto him</i> (1 Nephi 17:22). </td>
  <td>	<i>Yea, do ye suppose that they would have been <b>led out</b> of bondage, if the Lord had not commanded Moses that he should <b>lead them out</b> of bondage? </i>(1 Nephi 17:24).<br><br>
<i>And notwithstanding they being <b>led,</b> the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, <b>leading them</b> by day and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God </i>(1 Nephi 17:30). <br><br>
<i>And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy them; and according to his word <b>he did lead them</b> </i>(1 Nephi 17:31).<br><br>
<i>And he <b>leadeth away</b> the righteous into precious lands, and the wicked he destroyeth, and curseth the land unto them for their sakes </i>(1 Nephi 17:38).<br><br>
<i>And they did harden their hearts from time to time, and they did revile against Moses, and also against God; nevertheless, ye know that they were <b>led forth</b> by his matchless power into the land of promise </i>(1 Nephi 17:42).<br><br>
<i>And now, after all these things, the time has come that they have become wicked ... I know that the day must surely come that they must be destroyed, save a few only, who shall be <b>led away</b> into captivity </i>(1 Nephi 17:43). </td>
