Surprisingly, it is Nephi, rather than Lehi, who first uses the name Jesus Christ, a name that is revealed to him by an angel (1 Nephi 12:18, original manuscript; 2 Nephi 25:19). Like his younger brother Jacob, who shares his appreciation for the writings of Isaiah, Nephi frequently uses the title "Holy One of Israel" (10 times). Among Book of Mormon speakers, this title is only used by prophets on the small plates.<br><br>
In the introduction to the account of his own visions, Nephi cites a prophecy of his father concerning the baptism of the "Lamb of God" (1 Nephi 10:10). Nephi’s questions about his father’s teachings led to a vision of his own, where an angel showed him the Lamb’s future mission (1 Nephi 11-14). Aside from the angel himself, Nephi references Christ as the "Lamb" or "Lamb of God" more than any other speaker in the Book of Mormon text (more than 22 times). Compare this to Moroni (5 times), Alma (twice), Amulek (once), and Mormon (once). <br><br>
The revelations Nephi received figure significantly in his writings. Nephi uses the adjective great most frequently to refer to "great things," almost always in reference to things that are revealed or done by God, as well as what he has personally witnessed. <br><br>
In addition to the teachings of his father and his own revelations from God, Nephi seems to have been greatly influenced by the records on the plates of brass. He speaks of his delight in the scriptures and in using them to persuade others to believe in Christ and his mission (2 Nephi 4:15-16; 11:4). He has a particular preference and love for Isaiah’s prophecies, although the writings of Moses, Zenos, Zenock, and Neum are also specifically mentioned (1 Nephi 19:10-23).
