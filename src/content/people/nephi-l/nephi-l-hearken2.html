  <td><i>	Do ye believe that our fathers, who were the children of Israel, would have been led away out of the hands of the Egyptians if they had not <b>hearkened unto the words</b> of the Lord? </i>(1 Nephi 17:23). <br><br>
<i>Now ye know that Moses was commanded of the Lord to do that great work; and ye know that <b>by his word</b> the waters of the Red Sea were divided hither and thither, and they passed through on dry ground </i>(1 Nephi 17:26).<br><br>
<i>Yea, and ye also know that Moses, <b>by his word</b> according to the power of God which was in him, smote the rock, and there came forth water, that the children of Israel might quench their thirst </i>(1 Nephi 17:29).<br><br>
<i>And it came to pass that <b>according to his word</b> he did destroy them; and <b>according to his word</b> he did lead them; and <b>according to his word</b> he did do all things for them; and <b>there was not any thing done save it were by his word</b> </i>(1 Nephi 17:31).<br><br>
<i>Behold, the Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God. But behold, <b>this people [the Canaanites] had rejected every word of God,</b> and they were ripe in iniquity; and the fulness of the wrath of God was upon them; and the Lord did curse the land against them, and bless it unto our fathers; yea, he did curse it against them unto their destruction, and he did bless it unto our fathers unto their obtaining power over it </i>(1 Nephi 17:35).<br><br>
<i>Ye are swift to do iniquity but slow to remember the Lord your God. Ye have seen an angel, and he spake unto you; yea, ye have heard his voice from time to time; and he hath spoken unto you in a still small voice, but ye were past feeling, that <b>ye could not feel his words;</b> wherefore, he has spoken unto you like unto the voice of thunder, which did cause the earth to shake as if it were to divide asunder </i>(1 Nephi 17:45).<br><br>
<i>And ye also know that by the power of <b>his almighty word</b> he can cause the earth that it shall pass away; yea, and ye know that <b>by his word</b> he can cause the rough places to be made smooth, and smooth places shall be broken up. O, then, why is it, that ye can be so hard in your hearts? </i>(1 Nephi 17:46). </td>
