If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be <b>visited</b> after the <b>visitation</b> of all men; then the Lord hath not sent me. <br><br>
But if the Lord make a new thing, and the <b>earth open her mouth and swallow them up,</b> with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord </i>(Numbers 16:29-30).

And the <b>earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up,</b> and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. <br><br>
They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. <br><br>
And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, <b>Lest the earth swallow us up</b> also. <br><br>
And there came out a <b>fire</b> from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense </i>(Numbers 16:32-35). 
<br><br><i>
This is that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah, when they strove against the Lord: <br><br>
And the <b>earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up</b> together with Korah, when that company died, what time the <b>fire</b> devoured two hundred and fifty men: and <b>they became a sign.</b></i>
