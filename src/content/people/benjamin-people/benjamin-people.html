During his farewell address, Benjamin relates the words of an angel who appeared to him and testified of the coming of Christ and His redemption. The response of the people, as given in the Book of Mormon, incorporates words and phrases from the angel’s message. <br><br>
The angel testified, "For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent . . . <b><i>shall come down from heaven among the children of men"</i></b> (Mosiah 3:5). The angel also said, "And he shall be called <b><i>Jesus Christ, the Son of God,</i></b> the Father of <b><i>heaven and earth,</i></b> the <b><i>Creator</i></b> of all things from the beginning" (Mosiah 3:8). In their response, after hearing the angel’s message, the people affirm, "We believe in <b><i>Jesus Christ, the Son of God,</i></b> who <b><i>created heaven and earth,</i></b> and all things; who <b><i>shall come down among the children of men"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:2). The angel also spoke of "<b><i>the atoning blood of Christ" </i></b>(Mosiah 3:18). The people plead, "O have mercy, and apply <b><i>the atoning blood of Christ"</i></b> (Mosiah 4:2). <br><br>
The angel warned that the wicked who do not repent "have <b><i>drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 3:26). The people enter into a covenant to do God’s will and obey his commandments, "that we may not <b><i>drink out of the cup of the wrath of God"</i></b> (Mosiah 5:5).  <br><br>
The angel said that Christ would "cast out devils, or the <b><i>evil</i></b> spirits which dwell in the <b><i>hearts</i></b> of the children of men" (Mosiah 3:6). When the people are converted, they respond that the Lord had "wrought a mighty change in . . . our <b><i>hearts,</i></b> that we have no more disposition to do <b><i>evil,</i></b> but to do good continually" (Mosiah 5:2). The gospel of Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost had cast the evil from their hearts, just as Jesus would cast out evil spirits. <br><br>
The angel warned that the wicked who rebel against God and do not repent "are consigned to an <b><i>awful view</i></b> of their own guilt and abominations" (Mosiah 3:25). In contrast to the wicked, Benjamin’s people are converted and, through the manifestations of the Spirit, "have <b><i>great views</i></b> of that which is to come" (Mosiah 5:3).
