Korihor’s deceptive strategy included presenting only a part of the truth and then attacking it. We can see this in how he disparaged the doctrine of the Fall of Man. "Ye say that this people is a guilty and a fallen people, because of the transgression of a parent. Behold, I say that a child is not guilty because of its parents" (Alma 30:25). This kind of argument would appeal to the unwary because it makes the doctrine of the Fall seem unfair. But it was deceptive. <br><br>
Nephite doctrine taught that Christ atoned for Adam’s transgression and that little children have eternal life through the Redeemer (Mosiah 15:25). Nephite doctrine also taught that individuals were responsible for their own sins and transgressions; however, Korihor’s incomplete characterization tainted the doctrine with an appearance of unfairness to lead people away. <br><br>
<b>Key Insights</b> <br><br>
Korihor’s practice of misrepresentation by only presenting a partial truth was effective at deceiving many in Alma’s day, but he was eventually confounded and abandoned by the devil and those who once supported him. The account of Korihor shows us how the adversary tries to deceive by presenting only an incomplete version of the truth. When we read about Korihor’s false teachings, we should consider how they reveal the strategies in the devil’s playbook. An awareness of those evil tactics can help us to be wise, and detect and avoid deception today.
