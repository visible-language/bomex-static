These men were kings during the fourteen-year mission of Ammon and his brethren around 90-77 BC. Each of these kings was a convert to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, along with many thousands of their people. These conversions were remarkable because the Lamanites had previously been inveterate enemies of the Nephites for hundreds of years. This led to dramatic political and social changes among the people of Lehi.<br><br>
